Here are some suggestions that may help you manage your workload and reduce your stress levels:\n",

      "1. Prioritize your tasks: Make a list of all your assignments and exams, and then prioritize them based on their importance and deadlines. Focus on completing the most critical tasks first, and then work your way down the list.\n",

For example, if you have a research paper to write, break it down into smaller tasks like researching, outlining, drafting, and editing.\n",
      "3. Set realistic goals and deadlines: Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day or a week, and set deadlines that are achievable. This can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed and increase your sense of control over your work.\n",
      "4. Seek help when needed: Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Talk to your professors, classmates, or a tutor about your struggles, and seek their support. You may also find study groups or academic support services on campus that can help you stay on track.\n",
      "5. Take breaks and practice self-care: It's important to take breaks and practice self-care to avoid burnout. Take short breaks between study sessions, do something you enjoy, like exercise, reading, or spending time with friends and family, and make sure to get enough sleep.\n",
      "6. Stay organized: Keep all your notes and materials organized, and make sure you have everything you need for each class or study session. This can help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed\n"
