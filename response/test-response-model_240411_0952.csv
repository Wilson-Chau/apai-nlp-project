0,Do I have too many issues for counseling?,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",depression,"It is very common for people to have multiple issues that they want to (and need to) address in counseling.  I have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration, there is often an underlying fear that they  ""can't be helped"" or that they will ""be too much for their therapist."" I don't know if any of this rings true for you. But, most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not,  people have numerous significant stressors in their lives.  Let's face it, life can be complicated! Therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session. Most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress.  You can never have too many issues to address in counseling.  All of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling.",3,1971,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

Losing an erection during sexual activity can be a distressing and frustrating experience, especially if it's happening frequently. It's important to understand that this is a common issue that can have many different causes, including physical, emotional, and psychological factors.

Here are some possible causes of erectile dysfunction (ED):

1. Physical causes: These can include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and certain medications.
2. Emotional causes: Stress, anxiety, depression, and relationship issues can all contribute to ED.
3. Psychological causes: Performance anxiety, fear of failure, and negative self-talk can all play a role in ED.

It's important to note that ED can be a sign of a larger issue, such as depression or anxiety, so it's important to speak with a mental health professional if you're experiencing persistent problems.

Here are some things you can try to help improve your erectile function:

14,Can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?,"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?",depression,"Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it"" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC",2,5423,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

3. Focus on your strengths: Rather than dwelling on your weaknesses or failures, try to focus on your strengths and accomplishments. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.

The bloating and extreme cravings do not help either.Making sure your schedule is light and you have things to assist you can be so helpful. Different essential oils like lavender may calm you down, or orange which can uplift your mood. Homeopathy can be effective and gentle during this time as well. Birth control is known to help reduce the extreme spikes in hormones and can reduce your emotional and physical pain. Perhaps even psychiatric medication like an SSRI can help . If you are interested in going down the medication route, be sure to ask the doctor about potential side effects and risks . Reducing your processed sugar intake may help a lot as well. Exercising, spending time outside, practicing stress management and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can all be useful as well.",0,211,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

I just want a better life for my fiancée and the kids than I did.###You: [/INST]  Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. It takes a lot of courage to be honest about your struggles, and I appreciate your trust in me. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to achieve your goals, especially when it comes to providing a better life for your loved ones.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that you are not alone in this struggle. Many people face similar challenges, and it's okay to feel uncertain or lost. The key is to start small and take small steps towards your goals. It's okay to begin with small, manageable actions that can help you build momentum and confidence.

One way to start is by identifying your strengths and passions. What are some things that you enjoy doing? What are some things that you're good at? These can be clues to the types of careers or activities that might be a good fit for you. Additionally, you can try setting specific, achievable goals for yourself, such as taking a course or gaining experience in a particular area.

It's also important to remember that progress may not always be linear or quick. It's okay to take things one step at a time and to be patient with yourself as you work towards your goals. Remember to be kind to yourself and to celebrate your small victories along the way.

Lastly, don't be afraid to seek support from others. Whether it's a mentor, a coach, or a supportive friend or family member, having someone to talk to and offer guidance can be incredibly helpful.

53,How can I find myself again?,"I just don't know what I want in life anymore. I'm can't figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused. I can't put things into perspective at all. I'm just stuck, and I'm disappointed with my lack of accomplishments.",depression,"If you are a people-pleaser type or a natural caretaker, you can slowly ""lose yourself"" over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself.  If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot.  Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to ""take care of everything"" because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly. Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own.  You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well; if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don't create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you.  If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, it's easy to re-create this in adult relationships.In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this ""self sacrifice at the expense of others"" is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretaker/enabler/people-pleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self.  Basically, you spend so much time helping other people that you don't make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment.  Before you realize it, you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are.  Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable, but if you are always that person that rescues, those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them.  In conclusion, learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life.  It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now.  Take one small step at at a time.  Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy, and limit your contact and/or set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soul-searching.  Meanwhile, engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with, get yourself outside in the fresh air, get some good sleep, and eat some nourishing food!",0,203,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're feeling stuck and uncertain about our lives. It's completely normal to feel this way at times, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in this feeling.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that it's okay to not have everything figured out right away. Life is a journey, and it's normal to take time to discover what truly brings you fulfillment and happiness. It's important to be patient and kind to yourself as you navigate through this process.

One exercise that may help you gain perspective and clarity is to make a list of your values and priorities. What is most important to you in life? What do you stand for? What do you want to achieve? Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you identify patterns and themes that may be holding you back.

Another approach is to try and identify any negative self-talk or beliefs that may be contributing to your feelings of distraction and unfocused. Are there any beliefs or thoughts that you've been telling yourself that may not be serving you well? Are there any beliefs or thoughts that you can challenge and replace with more positive and empowering ones?

Lastly, it may be helpful to explore different activities and hobbies that bring you joy and fulfillment. Sometimes, when we're feeling stuck, it can be helpful to try new things and see what brings us happiness and fulfillment.

70,My parents are getting a divorce and I feel depressed,I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,depression,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen",0,241,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

Really ask yourself, ""are they facts?"" or are they your perspective on events.  In regards to your coping behaviours at night, it sounds very isolating and also very silenced.  As opposed to the sad music, why not try all music, allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you.  One of the other recommendations I would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way. Some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant, though and I would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future.",1,195,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

Anytime sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it is important to get help immediately. A therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going through, while also working with you to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals for your future. While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task, it will only make things easier and give you a sense of hope and purpose for your future. With the new year right around the corner, this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals related to living a more fullfilling life. Hang in there. With a support system in place and a healthy mindset, things can only get easier. Best of luck to you!",3,147,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

###User: I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me ""I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,"" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasn't attractive, I wasn’t beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. I'm still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasn't good enough and that I'm no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but don't know if I should.###You: [/INST]","<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel lonely or isolated, especially during a breakup. It can be a difficult and emotional time, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.

It's great that you have a girlfriend who cares about you deeply, even if you don't always see eye-to-eye. It's important to communicate your feelings with her in a respectful and empathetic manner. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're feeling and what you need from her in this time.

It's also important to focus on your own well-being during this time. Have you considered reaching out to a therapist or counselor to talk through your feelings and get some support? They can provide you with a safe and confidential space to process your emotions and work through any challenges you're facing.

Remember that you don't have to go through this alone. There are many resources available to help you work through this difficult time, including therapy, support groups, and online forums.

Lastly, try to be kind to yourself and practice self-care. Take time for yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and prioritize your mental health. Remember that you are not alone and that things will get better with time and support.

Remember, you don't have to face this alone. Reach out to me or a professional for help, and know that you are not alone.","Thank you for sharing your feelings with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about your struggles, and I'm here to offer you support and guidance.

###User: I am always down and out. Could this be postpartum depression?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for reaching out for support. It's completely understandable to feel down and out at times, especially after having a baby. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common condition that can affect new mothers, and it's important to consider this possibility if you're experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or overwhelm.

Here are some signs that may indicate PPD:

1. Persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness: If you find yourself feeling down or depressed for weeks or months after giving birth, and these feelings don't improve with time, it could be a sign of PPD.
2. Loss of interest in activities: If you used to enjoy activities but now find them uninteresting or overwhelming, it could be a sign that you're struggling with PPD.
3. Changes in appetite or sleep patterns: If you're experiencing significant changes in your appetite or sleep patterns, such as difficulty sleeping or overeating, it could be a sign of PPD.
4. Difficulty bonding with your baby: If you're having trouble connecting with your baby or feeling disconnected from your child, it could be a sign of PPD.
5. Fear of leaving your baby: If you're experiencing intense fear or anxiety about leaving your baby alone, it could be a sign of PPD.

It's important to remember that PPD is a treatable condition, and there are many resources available to help you manage your symptoms and improve your mental health. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Reach out to your healthcare provider: Your healthcare provider can help you determine if you're experiencing PPD and provide you with a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an example:A (Action or Event): You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B (Behavior or Response): You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C (Consequence): You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend ""Feeling better, getting better, staying better"" by Alber Ellis.

It takes a lot of courage to open up about one's emotional pain, and I'm here to offer you support and guidance.

Firstly, please know that you are not alone in this. Many people experience similar feelings of abandonment and rejection in their relationships, and it's important to recognize that these feelings are valid and deserving of attention.

It's understandable that you might feel like there's something wrong with you, given the experiences you've had. However, it's important to recognize that people's actions are not a reflection of your worth as a person. People's behaviors are shaped by their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and it's not uncommon for them to prioritize their own needs and boundaries over those of others.

Rather than focusing on what might be ""wrong"" with you, I suggest trying to reframe your thinking around these experiences. Ask yourself: What are some patterns or beliefs that I might be holding onto that are contributing to these feelings of abandonment? Are there any negative self-talk or beliefs that I could challenge and replace with more positive and realistic ones?

In terms of bettering yourself, one important step is to practice self-compassion and self-care. This might look like engaging in activities that bring you joy, practicing mindfulness or meditation, or seeking support from friends, family,","Thank you for sharing your struggles with me.

However, it's concerning to hear that you're struggling with staying up late and sleeping too much, as well as feeling disconnected from your friends and interests.

It's possible that you may be experiencing a period of depression or burnout. Depression is a common mental health condition that can cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities. Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion that can result from prolonged stress and overwork.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people experience depression and burnout at some point in their lives, and there are many resources available to help you cope. I encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide you with support and guidance. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your feelings and develop strategies to manage them.

141,"How do I get over anxiety, depression, and isolation?","I've have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?",depression,"The best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change, such as the recent death of a loved one, a lost relationship, or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this, what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle life’s ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. “You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.” Another quote I like is “You will find a way or you will find an excuse.” Don’t ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing, but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you, you will find a way. Don’t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical health, but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself. Also, find a meditation that works for you. There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises, visual and mental meditations, and many many more. Start making some positive changes in your life today! You can do it!",2,310,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

###User: I've have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for sharing your struggles with depression and anxiety. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and frustrated when it comes to managing these feelings, especially when it seems like they persist despite your efforts.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that healing is a process that takes time, patience, and self-compassion. It's okay to feel like you're not making progress as quickly as you'd like, or that you're still struggling with certain emotions or behaviors. Remember that healing is a journey, and it's normal to experience setbacks along the way.

Anxiety and social isolation can be particularly challenging to overcome because they often stem from deeper emotional and psychological issues. For example, anxiety can be a response to past traumas or stressors, while social isolation can be a coping mechanism for feeling overwhelmed or vulnerable.

One helpful approach to managing anxiety and social isolation is to focus on building a strong support network. This can include friends, family, or a therapist who can provide emotional validation and guidance. It can also be helpful to engage in activities that promote feelings of connection and community, such as volunteering, joining a club or organization, or taking a class.

In addition, there are several evidence-based therapies that can be effective in managing anxiety and social isolation. These include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors, and exposure therapy, which involves gradually exposing oneself to situations or stimuli that trigger anxiety.

Remember, healing is a process that requires time, effort, and support. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it.","Thank you for sharing your struggles with depression and anxiety.

145,Thoughts of afterlife causes anxiety,"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.",anxiety,"You might be surprised how normal you are. Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you - it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die - regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our day-to-day anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown.  Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety. Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment - the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die. Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and can't get to sleep.

146,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,anxiety,"Hi there, Thank you for your question. It's absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy. I have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist. There can be a few reasons why you might feel this way. First, it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger. You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with him/her. Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children, we might have bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might bully or ridicule us, and that experience can stay with us for a long time, making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this the case, as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists, this anxiety will subside with time and you will re-learn that it is safe to share. And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult. Regardless of the reason, it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist.",3,2910,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

###User: I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?###You: [/INST]  Hello there! Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns with me. It's completely normal to feel nervous or shaky when starting therapy, especially if it's your first time. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as:

1. Unfamiliarity: Going to therapy for the first time can be a new and unfamiliar experience, which can cause feelings of discomfort or anxiety.
2. Expectations: You may have certain expectations about what therapy will be like, and these expectations may not align with your actual experience.
3. Personal boundaries: You may be unsure of how to open up or share personal information with a stranger, which can lead to feelings of nervousness or discomfort.
4. Past experiences: If you've had negative experiences with therapy or mental health professionals in the past, you may feel apprehensive about starting again.

It's important to remember that these feelings are completely normal, and they don't necessarily mean that therapy isn't working for you. In fact, these feelings can be an indication that you're taking an important step towards addressing your mental health concerns.

Here are a few things you can try to help manage your nervousness during therapy sessions:

1. Practice deep breathing exercises: Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety.
2. Bring a support person: Having a trusted friend or family member accompany you to therapy can provide emotional support and help you feel more at ease.
3. Communicate with your therapist: Let your therapist know how you're feeling and ask them if there are any specific techniques they can use to help you feel more comfortable.","Hello there!

151,Overcoming fears,"I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I don't know how. What can I do?",anxiety,"Fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance I'll use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said ""I'm scared of snakes"", I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C",1,612,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

###User: I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I don't know how. What can I do?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for reaching out for support! It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and confront our fears, and I'm here to help you through this process. Here are some steps you can take to face your fear:

1. Identify the source of your fear: Reflect on what is causing your fear. Is it a specific situation, person, or object? Once you understand the source of your fear, you can start working on ways to address it.
2. Gradual exposure: Exposure therapy is a technique that involves gradually exposing yourself to the thing you fear in a controlled and safe environment. You can start by exposing yourself to small amounts of the feared object or situation, and gradually increase the duration or intensity over time.
3. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of therapy that helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with your fear. A therapist can work with you to identify these patterns and teach you new ways of thinking and behaving that can help you overcome your fear.
4. Mindfulness techniques: Mindfulness practices such as meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation can help you stay present and focused in the face of your fear. These techniques can help you manage your anxiety and increase your sense of control.

154,I have difficulty with communication,"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?",anxiety,"A good way to start is the language or ""self talk"" that is happening inside your mind.  Looking at your question, when it is said that the presentations ""make me feel stress"" you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self.  The presentations cannot give or take away your stress, that's something only you can do and you can do it!   What language can you change in your self talk?  For example, are you saying ""I can't speak in front of an audience! I'll fail?""  That sounds a lot different than ""I studied my butt off and if I practice speaking out loud, I can ace this presentation!""  Although this is a short answer, I do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence.",1,249,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

###User: I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for reaching out! It's completely normal to feel nervous or shy in situations like presentations, especially when it's a new experience for you. Here are some strategies that may help you build your confidence and feel more comfortable:

1. Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with the material and the setting. Try practicing in front of a mirror, a small group of friends or family members, or even by yourself.
2. Prepare thoroughly: Make sure you know your material inside and out. Research your topic, organize your thoughts, and create a clear and concise outline. The more prepared you are, the more confident you'll feel.
3. Take deep breaths: Before you start your presentation, take a few deep breaths to calm your nerves. This can help slow down your heart rate and reduce any physical symptoms of anxiety.
4. Focus on your message: Instead of worrying about how you're coming across, focus on the message you're trying to convey. Remember, you're speaking to share information or ideas, not to impress anyone with your public speaking skills.
5. Visualize success: Imagine yourself delivering a successful presentation and receiving positive feedback. Visualizing a positive outcome can help boost your confidence.
6. Seek support: Talk to your classmates or colleagues about your nerves and ask for their support. They may be able to offer tips or simply provide a listening ear.
7. Take small steps: Start small by presenting to a small group or in a low-stakes setting. As you become more comfortable, gradually work your way up to larger groups or more formal presentations.

   How can I feel more comfortable around other people?",anxiety,"There's a lot of layers there to your situation, and I'm focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others.  One layer is the daunting news that your son has autism.  Many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis.  The vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap one's head around.  Taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful.  Some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child, and others may experience guilt.  If either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you, it may be worth working through them with a therapist.  A support group list is available through www.autismspeaks.org and may help connect you with others raising children with autism.A second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in.  The trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others.  Engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process, as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships.",1,138,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

   How can I feel more comfortable around other people?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for sharing your story with me. It takes a lot of courage to open up about personal struggles, and I'm here to offer you support and guidance.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that you've been through a lot, and it's completely understandable that you might feel nervous or uncomfortable around people after going through an abusive relationship and caring for a child with autism. It's okay to take time for yourself to heal and prioritize your own well-being.

One way to start feeling more comfortable around other people is to gradually expose yourself to social situations in a way that feels safe and comfortable for you. This might mean starting with small steps, like attending a support group for people who have gone through similar experiences, or reaching out to a trusted friend or family member for social support.

It's also important to practice self-care and prioritize your own mental health. This might involve engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, taking a bath, or practicing yoga or meditation.

Remember, healing is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself the space to heal and grow at your own pace.

If you find it helpful, you might consider seeking out professional support from a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma and mental health. They can provide you with additional guidance and support as you work through your challenges.

It makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship. And you're right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partner's interest. Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle you're feeling? It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners, but it really is possible. If you have any concerns about being able to do this, then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful - and it really can be just about finding the way to share what you're feeling.As far as coping with anxiety, there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called Self-Help for Anxiety Management.

They are simply a product of your own mind, and they may not necessarily reflect reality. It's possible that your mind is playing tricks on you, and it's important to try to distinguish between what is real and what is not.

There are a few things you can try to help manage these types of hallucinations:

1. Practice mindfulness: When you start to feel like you're hearing something that might not be real, try to focus on the present moment and what you're experiencing right now. Mindfulness techniques can help you stay grounded in reality and reduce the likelihood of hallucinations.
2. Find ways to relax: If you're feeling stressed or anxious, try engaging in relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga. These can help reduce your overall stress levels and may help reduce the frequency of hallucinations.

222,What do I do when I have anxiety attacks?,"I get so much anxiety, and I don’t know why. I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes.",anxiety,"This is a very common question in my practice. Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue (ex. Depression, low self-esteem, fears). To decrease your anxiety symptoms it’s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: ""I don't need to worry, I am calm and relaxed"". 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house; presenting in front of others; going to social events; and having conversations with people. However, the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills (ex. deep breathing) the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful.

###User: I get so much anxiety, and I don’t know why. I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes.###You: [/INST]  Thank you for sharing your struggles with anxiety. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about the future, especially when it comes to making decisions or facing new challenges.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that anxiety is a common and treatable condition. Many people experience anxiety at some point in their lives, and there are many effective coping strategies and therapies available.

One thing that can be helpful is to identify the sources of your anxiety. Are there specific situations or triggers that cause you to feel anxious? Are there any patterns or themes that you notice in your thoughts or behaviors? Once you can identify the roots of your anxiety, you can start working on ways to manage and overcome it.

In the meantime, here are some general strategies that may help you manage your anxiety:

1. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help calm your mind and body.
2. Challenge negative thoughts: Try to reframe negative thoughts and beliefs that contribute to your anxiety. Ask yourself if there is evidence to support these thoughts, and try to replace them with more balanced and realistic ones.
3. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help reduce anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters.
4. Seek support: Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional can help you feel heard and understood, and provide valuable support and guidance.
5. Take breaks and prioritize self-care: Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as reading, listening to music, or taking a relaxing bath.

Remember, managing anxiety takes time and effort, but it is possible to learn and grow. Be patient","Thank you for sharing your struggles with anxiety. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about the future, especially when it comes to making decisions or facing new challenges.

239,"Sleeping, Anger and Anxiety","I have a lot of issues going on right now. First of all, I have a lot of trouble sleeping at times, while other nights I sleep too much and still feel quite tired. I’m also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours. Is there something wrong with me and if so what should I do?",anxiety,"Hi there. I have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling. A lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might be.First off, what stressors do you have in your life right now? Financial, relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people. They can often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all. Secondly, do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your family? Some of the symptoms listed here in this question (i.e. trouble sleeping, constant fatigue, too much sleep, anger & anxiety) are all common symptoms of depression. Often times, these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for ""just being tired."" Furthermore, it's important to ask yourself, if you are feeling worthless, problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death. If you are having these symptoms, please seek help IMMEDIATELY. Lastly, considering your stated symptoms I would recommend reaching out to your Doctor for further consult. It's always better to be safe and the earlier you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better! do Some helpful tips for the your Doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits (i.e. how much or little are you sleeping), make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks. I hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you.",1,177,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

240,I have come to the realization that my boyfriend and I want different things,"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like.

As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!",2,139,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

255,My son plays alone at recess,Is this something I should be worried about? Should I do something about it?,parenting,"It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships. Parents can usually tell when their child is happy. But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment, perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner. Others may internalize symptoms, appearing sad or withdrawn. A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone. A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground, and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play, unsure of how to join the group. Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends. Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child, but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group Ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play. If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen, or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys, the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own. I encourage well-meaning parents to choose words carefully. Use phrases like, ""Hey, I noticed something,"" or ""Let me help you be successful."" By showing respect, parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zone.When to seek professional help. When does isolation raise a red flag for long-term issues? True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood. Still, professional counseling should be considered if the anti-social behavior is causing the child significant distress, perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities. Also, parents should pay attention to how the child's social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety. The vast majority of children who define ""quality time"" as time alone are perfectly happy, healthy and normal. If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship, exhibiting what experts call ""social reciprocity,"" then parents can relax, and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company.",3,1239,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

It's also important to remember that children may have a range of reactions to difficult news, and it's okay if they don't fully understand or accept it right away. It's important to be patient and understanding, and to offer ongoing support and guidance as they process this difficult information.

Remember, the most important thing you can do is to be there for the child, to listen to their concerns, and to offer them love and support during this challenging time."

I have a great relationship with the oldest two children but I haven't developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child. I rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times. Is this normal?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It's completely normal for parents to have different levels of attachment and connection with each of their children, especially as they grow and develop at different rates. It's important to recognize that each child is unique and has their own needs, temperament, and developmental stage, which can affect the way they interact with their parents.

It's common for parents to feel a stronger connection with their oldest child, as they have had more time to bond and establish a relationship. At the same time, it's normal for the youngest child to require more attention and care, especially during the early years of life. As the youngest child grows and develops, it's likely that you will find yourself feeling more connected and attached to them as well.

It's important to recognize that it's okay to have different levels of attachment to each of your children, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you don't love or care for the youngest child as much. It's possible to love and care for all of your children equally, even if you don't feel the same level of attachment to each of them.

It's also important to consider the reasons why you may be feeling less attached to the youngest child. Are there any specific challenges or difficulties that you are experiencing with this child? Are there any unresolved emotions or stressors in your life that may be affecting your feelings towards this child?

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed or exhausted at times, especially when caring for multiple children. It's important to prioritize self-care and seek support from your partner, family, and friends when needed.","Thank you for sharing your concerns with me.

289,"My daughter calls me crazy, and I’m not sure how to handle that","I am divorced and happily remarried. Our blended family of children are in their 20s. My youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. He was abusive to me, and I left with injuries. He never wanted kids, and I did. He paid child support only through forced wage earners. Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom. I don’t deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. I’m not sure how to handle this.",parenting,"Hi Arkansas, Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. Your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. It's a form of woman abuse and child abuse. He's likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and he's not considering how it's affecting the kids. I've seen this happen in many families; parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. It's your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it. While you can't change his behaviours, and I think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids. For your children, you can refuse to enter into the war he's setting up. He's trying to provoke you into acting ""crazy"", but you don't have to fall for this. If you run around screaming ""he's lying!"", it only makes you look more 'crazy'. Try to stay calm, and don't put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. One day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesn't have the power to destroy their love for you. Children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already, I'd bet, but they don't know how to cope with that. If he's the only one fighting a war, you're helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Don't engage on his level. Don't blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don't need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their father's agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isn't the answer, but have compassion for their position. This picture isn't their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices.Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You don't need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that some day, they will come back and be grateful. It may take a while, you can't rush it, but they will see you for who you are. Your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on. I'd recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded. Good luck!",4,687,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

It's completely understandable that you're concerned about your daughter's safety and well-being, especially given the behavior you've described.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for children to engage in behaviors that are not appropriate or respectful towards their siblings, especially at a young age. It's important to recognize that this behavior is not a reflection of the child's inherent nature, but rather a learning opportunity for them to understand and manage their emotions and actions.

I would encourage you to explore alternative approaches that focus on teaching your children empathy, respect, and healthy communication skills. Here are some suggestions:

1. Model empathetic behavior: Children learn by observing and imitating the behavior of adults. Make sure to model empathetic behavior towards your daughter and others, and encourage your son to do the same.
2. Use positive language: Instead of focusing on what not to do, try using positive language to encourage your son to behave appropriately. For example, you could say, ""I like it when you play nicely with your sister.""

I would encourage you to explore alternative approaches that focus on teaching your children empathy, respect, and healthy communication skills. Here are some suggestions:

1. Model empathetic behavior: Children learn by observing and imitating the behavior of adults. Make sure to model empathetic behavior towards your daughter and others, and encourage your son to do the same.
2. Use positive language: Instead of focusing on what not to do, try using positive language to encourage your son to behave appropriately. For example, you could say, ""I like it when you play nicely with your sister.""
3. Teach conflict resolution skills: Encourage your children to express their feelings and needs in a respectful manner, and"
305,How can my boyfriend forgive me when I can't forgive myself?,"I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. In the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. I used to party a lot, and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else. These situations were never more than just kissing. I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend, and he decided to forgive and move forward with me. I love him so much and want to work things out too, but I'm having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. I can't seem to forgive myself. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.",self-esteem,"Hi Cerritos,This is an interesting twist because it's more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness. You are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions. My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. You don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. You only have to have the maturity to recognise when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? Were you shamed as a child? Did you learn that you deserved to be punished? Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. The bar is too high for you. If I was your therapist, I would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound. If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself. Forgiving doesn't mean ""it was okay""; forgiving simply means that it happened, that you can't erase it, and that you don't want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore. You have done many things here that you can feel proud of! You've 'come clean', you've been honest, you've taken responsibility for your actions, you've not tried to minimize what you did, and you've chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend. These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. You are acting very honourably. It's time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that you've learned from them and are a better person now. It's not our mistakes...not our worst moments that define us...it's how we handle them afterwards.I wish you growth and happiness.",3,1015,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

###User: My husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me, and I moved out. He is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right. I'm not sure if I trust that he will not go back to his old ways.###You: [/INST]  Thank you for sharing this difficult situation with me. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we need help and support, and it's great to hear that your husband is seeking professional help.

It's completely understandable that you may be hesitant to trust your husband again after he has hurt you in the past. However, it's important to remember that change is possible, and with the right support and resources, your husband can learn how to communicate and treat you in a more respectful and loving way.

One important thing to consider is whether your husband is willing and committed to doing the necessary work to change his behavior. Has he been consistent in his efforts to seek help and make positive changes? Is he willing to attend therapy sessions and work on his issues with a therapist or counselor? These are important signs that he is serious about making things right and may help you feel more confident in his ability to change.

It's also important to take care of yourself during this time. Have you considered seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist yourself? It can be helpful to have a safe and supportive space to process your feelings and concerns.

Remember, healing and rebuilding trust takes time and effort from both parties. It's okay to take things slow and to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If you do decide to give your husband another chance, it's important to set clear boundaries and expectations for how you want to be treated moving forward.

Remember, you deserve to be treated with love, respect, and kindness in a relationship. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and prioritize your own emotional well-being.","Thank you for sharing this difficult situation with me.

391,Why do I feel like I'm always wrong in everything in my relationship?,"My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that I'm doing things she finds disrespectful even when I don't mean it like that. For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work ""sweetheart."" I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?",workplace-relationships,"Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns. One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define ""infidelity"". Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, ""I feel you distancing from me."" In other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs. The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a ""sweetheart."" The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean ""you're so sweet and kind"", ""my dear"", or in a flirtatious manner to mean ""sweetie."" The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said.  If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, ""I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much."" Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying ""sweetheart"" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, ""I'm sorry."" However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says ""I'm sorry"", I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating. For more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469.",9,5987,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique cultural and personal beliefs, and it's okay if you don't always agree or understand each other's perspectives.

Here are a few suggestions that may help you navigate these situations with sensitivity and respect:

1. Practice active listening: When you're in a situation where there are different customs or beliefs, make an effort to truly listen to what others are saying. Try to understand their perspective and why they hold certain beliefs or practices.
2. Be open-minded: It's important to be open to learning about and respecting the beliefs and customs of others, even if they're different from your own. Try to approach these situations with a mindset of curiosity and openness, rather than judgment or resistance.
3. Find common ground: While it's important to respect and honor the unique beliefs and customs of each individual, it's also possible to find common ground and ways to connect with others. Look for shared values or practices that can help bring people together and create a sense of unity.
4. Communicate with empathy: If you're feeling uncomfortable or unsure about how to navigate a situation with different customs, try communicating with empathy and understanding. Listen to the concerns and feelings of others, and express your own feelings and thoughts in a respectful and considerate manner.

Remember, it's okay to have different beliefs and customs, and it's important to respect and honor the unique perspectives of each individual. By being open-minded, empathetic, and respectful, you can help create a more harmonious and inclusive environment for everyone.","Thank you for sharing this question with me.

422,How can I avoid having past traumatic experiences affect my present and future?,"I have family issues, and my dad was both violent and a cheater.",trauma,"I can imagine how incredibly difficult this must be for you. Having past traumatic experiences creap up on you without warning can be very scary and stressful. You may be suffering from symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder. Getting evaluated by a professional would be a good step to take next. By seeking treatment and having a therapist who you trust and can connect with, you will gain the ability to think about your experiences without it significantly interfering with your daily functioning. A therapist can also help you to develop new coping stragies to be used during recall of these experiences and help you to adopt healthy thought patterns. I would also recommend that you seek support from loved ones. Sometimes just talking about your experiences and associated feelings will alleviate some of the emotional troubles you are suffering from. Lastly, you may find meditation or mindfulness work to be of great benefit. Having the ability to live in the present moment should reduce the effects of your traumatic experiences interfering with recalling your past or looking forward to your future.

It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. I don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I don't know if he's evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest. A good therapist can support you in these goals.

###User: The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.###You: [/INST]  Thank you for sharing this concern with me. It's understandable that the sounds of eating and breathing can be distracting and frustrating, especially when they're loud and disruptive. However, it's important to approach this issue in a constructive and respectful manner.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that mouth breathing and snoring can be a sign of a larger issue, such as sleep apnea or other respiratory problems. These conditions can have serious health consequences if left untreated, so it's important to consult with a medical professional to rule out any underlying health issues.

In the meantime, there are some strategies you can try to help manage the sounds of eating and breathing:

1. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness techniques can help you focus on the present moment and reduce your reactivity to distracting sounds. You can try activities like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to help you relax and focus.
2. Use earplugs or earmuffs: Earplugs or earmuffs can help block out loud sounds, including mouth breathing and snoring. There are many different types available, so you may need to try a few different options to find what works best for you.
3. Communicate with the person: If the sounds of eating and breathing are coming from someone else, it's important to communicate your concerns in a respectful and empathetic manner. You can try talking to the person privately and explaining how their sounds are affecting you, and ask if they would be willing to take steps to reduce the noise.
4. Seek support: It can be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings and concerns. They can provide you with additional strategies and support to manage your reactions to the sounds of eating and breath","Thank you for sharing this concern with me.

525,How do I open up to someone?,"Ever since my ex-boyfriend and I broke up, I can't seem to get close to anyone else. I know I'm completely over him, but I just can't break down my walls and let someone new into my life.",intimacy,"Hi Bend, You're scared, right? That makes sense. Each time we have a break-up we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and there's a vulnerability in that; we can get hurt. Who you partner with long-term is a big decision and it determines 90% of our happiness in life. The good news is that when we're just starting to get to know someone, we can take it slow. I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here, and that's okay. We are naturally people of attachment and it won't likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesn't put up walls. So part of what I want to say here is don't pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. :)As well, there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down, or will come down for the right person. First, think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner.Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like ""No one will ever love me again?"", or ""I'm going to get hurt again"", or ""I can't trust myself""? If so, write down what these thoughts are, and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen, but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening!! It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe, good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts, and add the positive ones. It's simple but very powerful.Lastly, take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls? When we act as though something is true, we start to feel it and believe it more.I hope you will find yourself back on track eventually, with time. :)",2,482,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

It's important to acknowledge that you and your partner have different needs and desires when it comes to sexual intimacy. It's not uncommon for individuals to have different preferences and comfort levels when it comes to sexual activity, and it's important to prioritize open and honest communication in your relationship.

It's important to recognize that masturbation and pornography can be a normal and healthy part of a person's sexual expression, as long as it is not negatively impacting their relationships or daily life. However, it's also important to consider the impact that your partner's behavior may be having on your own feelings and needs.

It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and concerns.

###User: We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for sharing this with me. It's understandable that your partner may feel upset or angry about things you've done in the past, especially if they are significant or have impacted your relationship. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own past experiences and baggage, and it's not fair or healthy to penalize someone for things they did before you met them.

It's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. Here are some things you could try:

1. Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your past and how it has affected your relationship. Be sure to listen to their concerns and feelings, and try to find a way to move forward together.
2. Consider seeking professional help, such as couples therapy, to work through any issues that are causing tension in your relationship. A therapist can provide a safe and neutral space for both of you to discuss your feelings and work towards a resolution.
3. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and has their own struggles. It's important to be patient, understanding, and supportive of each other as you work through these issues together.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and to seek help if you feel like you're struggling to cope with your partner's anger or upset. You deserve to be in a healthy and fulfilling relationship, and with time, effort, and support, it's possible to work through any challenges and come out stronger on the other side.","Thank you for sharing this with me.

She may have been coming to this point over a period of time, and has only finally said so. It's also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisis...she's changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it.

###User: My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.###You: [/INST]","<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

It's understandable that you're in shock and don't know how to respond. This can be a very sensitive and challenging situation, and it's important to approach it with empathy and concern for her well-being and the health of her unborn baby.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that morning sickness is a common and normal part of pregnancy, and there are many safe and effective treatments available. However, it's important to note that smoking marijuana is not a safe or recommended treatment for morning sickness, as it can have negative effects on the developing fetus.

It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your daughter-in-law about your concerns. You can express your concerns in a non-judgmental and supportive way, and encourage her to seek medical advice and treatment. It's important to listen to her perspective and be respectful of her choices, while also being clear about your concerns for her and the baby's health.

It may also be helpful to provide her with information and resources on safe and effective treatments for morning sickness, such as ginger, acupressure, and other natural remedies. You can also offer to help her find a prenatal massage or acupuncture, which can help to alleviate morning sickness symptoms without putting the baby at risk.

Ultimately, it's important to prioritize your daughter-in-law's and the baby's health and well-being, and to seek professional advice and support if you have any concerns.

630,How can I avoid family members who stress me out?,"My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore.",family-conflict,"It is understandable that it's very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. You cannot change your mother's feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being ""abandoned."" Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. Nonetheless, it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself. It is likely that your mother's ""complaints"" may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. In this case, you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain, ""This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost everyday. It's very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed. I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance."" When empathy and understanding is communicated, recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help.After sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help, the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother and/or niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally, taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite. You could then say to her if she complains again, ""I cannot change the way you feel in this situation and I encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what I could do is .........(explain what you could do to help).""www.PsychologyResource.ca",5,2737,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

It's understandable that you may feel overwhelmed and frustrated by your mother's constant calls about your sister's abandoned niece.

It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling to forgive someone, especially when it's a family member. It's completely understandable that you may feel hurt or angry with your mom after what happened, and it's okay to take time to process those emotions.

Forgiveness is a complex and ongoing process, and it's not always easy to do. It's important to recognize that forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting what happened or excusing someone's actions. Rather, it's about letting go of the negative emotions associated with the event and moving forward in a positive way.

One way to start the process of forgiveness is to acknowledge your feelings and give yourself permission to feel them. It's okay to still feel upset or angry, and it's important to validate those emotions. You can also try writing down your feelings in a journal or talking to a trusted friend or therapist.

Another step in the forgiveness process is to try to understand your mom's perspective and why she made the mistakes she did. This can help you see things from her point of view and understand that she may have been struggling with her own issues at the time.

Finally, it may be helpful to practice empathy and compassion towards your mom. This can involve imagining how she may be feeling and trying to see things from her perspective. It's important to remember that your mom is a person with her own strengths and weaknesses, and she may be struggling with her own issues.

###User: I am a teenager, and my brother is a few years older. He has a girlfriend who is always with him. He never hangs out with me anymore. We were really close, and it is making me really sad.###You: [/INST]  Sorry to hear that you're feeling sad and left out because your brother is spending less time with you. It's understandable to feel this way, especially when you were close before.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that your brother's relationship with his girlfriend is not your problem. It's important to respect their relationship and boundaries, even if it means he doesn't have as much time for you.

However, you can still reach out to your brother and express how you're feeling. It's important to communicate your feelings in a respectful and non-accusatory way. You could try saying something like, ""Hey bro, I've noticed you've been spending less time with me lately and it's really making me sad. Is everything okay? Can we find a way to hang out together again?""

It's also important to focus on other friendships and activities that bring you joy. Having a balanced social life can help you feel less lonely and more fulfilled. You could try joining a club or group that interests you, or reaching out to other friends who you can hang out with.

Remember, it's okay to feel sad when someone you care about is spending less time with you. But it's important to communicate your feelings in a respectful way and to focus on other positive relationships and activities in your life.","Sorry to hear that you're feeling sad and left out because your brother is spending less time with you.

Help me out###You: [/INST]  Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns with me. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling with something, and I'm here to listen and offer support.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that keeping secrets can be a challenging and stressful experience, especially when it involves sensitive or personal matters. It's understandable that you don't want to hurt your wife and mom, but it's also important to consider the impact that keeping these secrets may have on your own mental health and well-being.

One option you could consider is seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. A mental health professional can provide a safe and confidential space for you to talk about your secrets and work through any emotions or concerns you may have. They can also offer you tools and strategies to manage your anxiety and help you find healthy ways to cope with this situation.

Another option is to consider talking to a trusted friend or family member who you feel comfortable confiding in. This can be a good way to find support and get some of the weight off your shoulders. However, it's important to choose someone who you trust and who will respect your privacy and confidentiality.

Lastly, it may be helpful to try some self-care strategies to manage your anxiety and find ways to relax and de-stress. This could include engaging in activities that you enjoy, practicing mindfulness or meditation, or finding ways to express yourself creatively.

Remember, you don't have to go through this alone.

689,Why does my husband like dressing as a female in our bedroom?,"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.",marriage,"Depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be ""normal"" in the bedroom, I can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you!  It DOESN'T necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you. That being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn't always what we identify as.  Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture. For example, many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly don't consider themselves kinky, submissive, or anything else.  It could be that your husband enjoys pretending/ fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband, father, son, friend etc.  Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because it's the opposite of what their life typically entails (e.g., a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at ""the mercy"" of someone else once a week). Each of us has a sexual script - a blueprint if you will of what we like and don't like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being ""normal.""  It's also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, sexual desires, and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives (Gagnon & Simon, 1973).You've been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment. ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations. It's like our own sex fingerprint. In my role as a couples counselor, I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ.  If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied, the relationship thrives. Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includes:Both partners taking ownership for the couple's sexual experiences.Both partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings.Both partners learning to meet one another's - needs, desires, and wishes while making sure his/her own needs are being met.If ""pegging"" your husband as it's called is a hard and fast no for you, that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script.  However, if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about ""needing"" to dress in a female fashion and/or be anally penetrated, you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesn't hurt either one of you or the marriage.My warmest wishes to you both!",4,6807,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

693,What makes a good marriage?,What makes a healthy marriage last?,marriage,"This is a fantastic question. In one sentence, I would say the following:Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires – if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less) and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say ""okay, I'm feeling really stressed about this right now. Let's discuss it in an hour."" And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing.

Is that really okay?",relationships,"Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C",4,365,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?###You: [/INST]  I understand that you are going through a difficult situation, and I want to assure you that you are not alone. Erectile dysfunction can be a challenging issue to navigate, and it's important to approach it with sensitivity and honesty.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that sexual frustration can have a significant impact on a person's mental and emotional well-being. It can lead to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and even depression. It's important to prioritize open and honest communication with your partner about your feelings and concerns.

Regarding your suggestion to your girlfriend, it's important to recognize that it's not okay to encourage or facilitate infidelity. While it may seem like an easy solution to her sexual frustration, it can lead to significant emotional distress and can ultimately damage the trust and intimacy in your relationship.

Instead, I recommend exploring other options that can help improve your sexual health and well-being. This can include seeking medical advice, trying different sexual positions or techniques, and prioritizing communication and connection with your partner.

Remember, sexual health is not just about the physical aspects of sex, but also the emotional and psychological aspects. It's important to prioritize your partner's feelings and needs, and to work together to find a solution that works for both of you.

In summary, while it may seem like a quick fix, it's not okay to encourage or facilitate infidelity as a solution to sexual frustration. Instead, prioritize open and honest communication with your partner, and explore other options that can help improve your sexual health and well-being.","I understand that you are going through a difficult situation, and I want to assure you that you are not alone.

I felt kind of hurt / shocked (or whatever the feeling was).  PERIOD.  THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY.  Wait for him to respond to your matter-of-fact statement.No matter what his response is, stick to your same message - don't get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing.  You can even add, ""I agree I could have misunderstood  it (event)....

It's important to acknowledge that being sensitive to stress and negative tone of voice is a common trait, and it's great that you're looking for ways to support your friend.

Here are some tips that may help you communicate more effectively with your friend:

1. Be aware of your tone: When communicating with your friend, make sure to be mindful of your tone of voice. Avoid using a harsh or critical tone, as this can easily escalate the situation. Instead, try to use a calm and empathetic tone.
2. Use ""I"" statements: When expressing your thoughts or feelings, try using ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements. This can help your friend feel less attacked or criticized. For example, instead of saying ""You always do this,"" say ""I feel frustrated when this happens.""
3. Practice active listening: Make sure to listen carefully to your friend and try to understand their perspective. Ask questions to clarify their thoughts and feelings, and try to respond in a way that shows you're actively listening.

These early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others. In his book Wired for Love, Stan Tatkin, PsyD writes “We learn to love ourselves precisely because we have experienced being loved by someone. We learn to take care of ourselves because somebody has taken care of us. Our self worth and self-esteem also develop because of other people.”  This could be very fruitful to explore in individual therapy with a relationship therapist who really gets it, you may have to interview a few to find the right fit; that's OK.

It takes a lot of courage to open up about these kinds of struggles, and I want you to know that you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with feelings of low self-worth and the belief that they are unlovable or unworthy of friendship.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that these feelings are not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are a unique and valuable individual, and you deserve to be loved and appreciated for who you are. It's okay to have flaws and imperfections, and it's important to be kind and compassionate towards yourself as you work through these feelings.

One thing that may help is to try to identify the sources of these feelings. Are there specific experiences or events that have led to these feelings of low self-worth? Are there any negative self-talk patterns or beliefs that you may be holding onto? Once you can identify the sources of these feelings, you may be able to challenge and reframe them in a more positive and realistic way.

Another helpful strategy is to practice self-compassion and self-care. This can involve treating yourself with kindness and respect, and engaging in activities that make you feel good about yourself and your life. This can help to boost your self-esteem and improve your overall well-being.

Finally, it may be helpful to seek out the support of friends, family, or a mental health professional. Talking through these feelings with someone who cares about you can be incredibly validating and can help you to feel less alone.

811,"Me and my girlfriend of 7 years are looking for some free couples counseling in Modesto, CA",We have been fighting a lot and have 3 kids but we both want to stay together. I need some help to save our family.,relationships,"Hello, I do not live in the California area. However, perhaps I could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling. First, I must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues, including family issues. If your girlfriend lives with you, most insurances now cover ""live-in partners,"" as well. If you have insurance, contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is included.Aside from insurance, the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation. Do you belong to a church or other religious organization? Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling, as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members.Another option might be to explore support groups within the area. There may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group. If you find there are no such groups in your area, there are anonymous, support groups online. Here is one such site: http://relationship.supportgroups.com/",3,120,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

###User: We have been fighting a lot and have 3 kids but we both want to stay together. I need some help to save our family.###You: [/INST]  Thank you for reaching out for help. It takes a lot of courage to admit when a relationship is struggling, especially when there are children involved. It's important to remember that saving a family takes effort and commitment from both parties, but it is possible with the right support and resources.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that fighting is not uncommon in relationships, especially when there are children involved. It's important to recognize that this is not a sign of failure, but rather a sign that there are deeper issues that need to be addressed.

Here are some steps you can take to work on saving your family:

1. Take a break: Sometimes, taking a break from each other can help you both gain some perspective and clarity. This can be as simple as taking a weekend trip apart or as involved as seeking individual counseling.
2. Communicate openly and honestly: Communication is key in any relationship, and it's especially important when there are children involved. Make sure to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings, needs, and concerns.
3. Seek outside help: Consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor. They can provide you with tools and strategies to improve communication, manage conflicts, and work on rebuilding your relationship.
4. Focus on the positive: While it's important to address the challenges in your relationship, it's also important to focus on the positive aspects. Make an effort to do things together as a family that bring you joy and happiness.
5. Prioritize self-care: Taking care of yourself is important for your own well-being, but it can also help improve your relationship. Make sure to prioritize self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends.

It's important to remember that saving a family takes effort and commitment from both parties, but it is possible with the right support and resources.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that fighting is not uncommon in relationships, especially when there are children involved. It's important to recognize that this is not a sign of failure, but rather a sign that there are deeper issues that need to be addressed.

Here are some steps you can take to work on saving your family:

1. Take a break: Sometimes, taking a break from each other can help you both gain some perspective and clarity. This can be as simple as taking a weekend trip apart or as involved as seeking individual counseling.
2. Communicate openly and honestly: Communication is key in any relationship, and it's especially important when there are children involved. Make sure to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings, needs, and concerns.
3. Seek outside help: Consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor. They can provide you with tools and strategies to improve communication, manage conflicts, and work on rebuilding your relationship.
4. Focus on the positive: While it's important to address the challenges in your relationship, it's also important to focus on the positive aspects. Make an effort to do things together as a family that bring you joy and happiness.
5. Prioritize self-care: Taking care of yourself is important for your own well-being, but it can also help improve your relationship. Make sure to prioritize self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends.

But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It's the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff.

One approach you could try is to have an open and non-judgmental conversation with your partner about how you're feeling.

###User: I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?###You: [/INST]  Hello there! Thank you for reaching out with your question. It's completely normal to have feelings and preferences when it comes to gender and sexuality, and it's important to respect and acknowledge these feelings.

Firstly, it's important to understand that sexuality exists on a spectrum, and it's not uncommon for people to identify as somewhere in between heterosexuality and homosexuality. Some people may identify as bisexual, pansexual, or queer, which means they have a fluid and complex sexual identity that can't be reduced to simple labels.

It's also worth noting that sexuality is separate from gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person's internal sense of their own gender, which may or may not align with the gender they were assigned at birth. Some people may identify as male, female, or non-binary, which means they don't identify as exclusively male or female.

In your case, if you don't feel any attraction to girls or guys, that's okay! It's important to acknowledge and respect your feelings, and to know that you don't have to fit into any particular label or category. It's okay to be somewhere in between, or to identify in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for you.

Remember, sexuality and gender identity are complex and multifaceted, and there's no one right way to experience or express them. It's important to be kind to yourself, and to seek out support and understanding from trusted friends, family, or mental health professionals if you need it.

In short, if you don't like girls or guys, that's okay! It's important to respect and acknowledge your feelings, and to know that you don't have to fit into any particular label or category.

837,Why do I want to be the opposite sex so much?,"I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female. I never had this desire before. All I can think about is being a woman. I don't get pleasure from my penis anymore either. Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.",lgbtq,"Hello, and thank you for reaching out to ask for help. Surely this is a very confusing time for you! If you have never had these feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew about yourself.  My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this started is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the connection.  I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It is really hard to say since I don’t know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will share you with you some thoughts.  Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out, stuff it, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, it’s usually not.  It’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now.  So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing, sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution about what is going on.  One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, but another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe that it is second possibility. And that is okay.  You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see a counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is important is that you find someone who is non-judgmental about what you are experiencing.    I wish you well. Robin J.

It takes a lot of courage to open up about personal feelings and struggles, and I want to acknowledge and appreciate your trust in me.

Firstly, I want to assure you that you are not alone in this feeling. Many people experience gender dysphoria or feelings of discomfort with their gender identity at some point in their lives. It's important to understand that these feelings are valid and can be a sign of a deeper issue that needs to be addressed.

It's important to recognize that your desire to be a woman may not necessarily mean that you want to transition to female. Gender identity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity, and it's okay if you're not sure how you feel or what you want.

I would encourage you to seek out professional help from a mental health provider who specializes in gender identity and expression. They can provide you with a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your feelings and work through any challenges you may be experiencing.

In the meantime, it can be helpful to practice self-care and prioritize your mental health. This may include engaging in activities that bring you joy, practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques, and reaching out to supportive friends and family members.

Remember, you are not alone and there are many resources available to help you work through this challenging time.

It's completely normal to have questions and doubts about your sexuality, especially during adolescence. It's a time of self-discovery and exploration, and it's okay to take your time figuring things out.

Firstly, it's important to understand that sexuality exists on a spectrum, and it's not uncommon for people to identify in different ways at different points in their lives. Some people may identify as straight, bisexual, gay, lesbian, or something else entirely. It's all okay!

Here are some things you can try to help you figure things out:

1. Reflect on your feelings: Take some time to think about your feelings and desires. What do you find yourself attracted to in others? Have you ever had any crushes or feelings for someone? These can be clues to your sexuality.
2. Explore your identity: Think about what you know about yourself and your identity. What are your values, beliefs, and interests? How do these align with your feelings and desires?
3. Talk to trusted friends or family: Consider talking to someone you trust about how you're feeling. They may be able to offer support and help you process your feelings.

843,"How can I get ""out of my head"" and stop obsessive thoughts?","Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?",behavioral-change,"Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,"" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories,  this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.",1,462,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

It's completely normal to have occasional scary thoughts or worries, and it's important to remember that you are not alone in this experience. Here are some strategies that may help you manage these thoughts and reduce their frequency and intensity:

1. Practice mindfulness: When you notice the scary thought entering your mind, take a deep breath and focus on the present moment. Pay attention to your surroundings, your breath, or a specific sensation in your body. This can help you shift your attention away from the scary thought and cultivate a sense of calm and grounding.
2. Challenge negative thoughts: Ask yourself if the thought is based in reality or if it's just a product of your imagination. Are there any evidence or facts to support the thought, or is it just a fear or assumption? Try to reframe the thought in a more positive or realistic light.
3. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can contribute to scary thoughts. Find a physical activity that you enjoy, such as walking, running, or yoga, and make it a regular part of your routine.
4. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your scary thoughts. Sharing your concerns with someone you trust can help you feel less alone and more supported. They may also offer valuable insights or coping strategies to help you manage your thoughts.

It's completely normal to have thoughts and feelings about death, especially when we're going through challenging times or experiencing difficult emotions. It's important to remember that death is a natural part of life, and it's okay to have thoughts and feelings about it.

It sounds like you're aware that you don't want to die and that you value your life and the lives of those around you. It's understandable to have moments where you imagine what would happen if something were to happen to you or someone you love. These thoughts can be a way of processing and coping with difficult emotions, and they don't necessarily mean that you're suicidal or that you want to die.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in these thoughts, and many people have similar feelings at some point in their lives. It can be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about these thoughts and feelings. They can provide support and help you find ways to manage them.

In the meantime, there are some things you can try to help manage these thoughts:

1. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and finding activities that bring you joy and relaxation.
2. Engage in activities that help you feel connected to life: Spend time with loved ones, pursue hobbies or interests that bring you happiness, or volunteer in your community","Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.

876,How can I get rid of my laziness?,"I am lazy. I am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but I never seem to shake the habits. I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. All I'm ever left with is regrets and a low grade. I am at an all-time low in my life, and I'm not even that old. I've always been a straight-A student, but now I'm getting C's and F's, and it hurts me to know that I am way better than that. It's not even like the work is hard.",behavioral-change,"I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. It sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree. Have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? If not, I would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. Some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. Sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. Know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change (which you clearly have). Once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area.

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your challenges with procrastination and low academic performance.

It's great that you are aware of the problem and are trying to talk yourself out of it. However, it might be helpful to take a step back and assess why you are procrastinating in the first place. Are you feeling overwhelmed or stressed about a particular assignment or task? Are there other factors at play, such as lack of motivation or a lack of clear goals? Once you understand the underlying reasons for your procrastination, you can start working on strategies to overcome it.

In terms of your academic performance, it's important to recognize that one or two bad semesters don't define your entire academic career.

It's completely understandable that you would want to re-engage with a counselor you had a positive experience with in the past. It's important to remember that counselors are trained professionals who are bound by ethical guidelines to respect your autonomy and dignity, and to act in your best interests.

If you have already left a message for your former counselor and he has not returned your call, it's possible that he may be busy or unavailable for various reasons. However, it's important to communicate your desire to be contacted back in a respectful and assertive manner.

You may want to consider sending a follow-up message or making a phone call to check in with your former counselor and express your interest in resuming counseling. You could say something like:

""Hello [Counselor's Name], I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my previous message and express my interest in resuming counseling with you. I understand that you may be busy, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could call me back at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.""

Remember to be patient and understanding, as counselors are not always available 24/7. It's important to respect their boundaries and to communicate your needs in a clear and respectful manner.

Giving wine as a gift may be appropriate, but it's essential to consider a few factors before making your decision. Firstly, it's important to ensure that the wine you give is appropriate for a professional setting. You may want to consider a high-quality wine that is not too expensive or exclusive, as you want to show your gratitude without creating any awkwardness or misunderstandings.

Additionally, you may want to consider the counselor's personal preferences and dietary restrictions. For example, if the counselor is a non-drinker or has specific dietary needs, giving wine may not be the most considerate gift.

Another option could be to give a non-alcoholic gift that still shows your appreciation and gratitude. For example, you could give a nice plant, a book related to their field of study, or a small token that represents your country's culture.

Thank you for reaching out with your concern. It's completely normal to feel frustrated when you're not getting the responses you want from your messages, especially when you feel like you're being ignored.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that people have different communication styles and priorities, and it's not always about you. Some people may be busy, preoccupied, or simply not interested in responding to every message they receive. It's possible that they might be reading your messages, but not feel compelled to respond right away.

Here are a few things you could try to improve your chances of getting a response:

1. Be clear and concise: Make sure your messages are easy to understand and don't require a lot of effort to respond to. Keep your messages short and to the point.
2. Use a friendly and approachable tone: People are more likely to respond to messages that are friendly and approachable. Avoid coming across as too pushy or demanding.
3. Give people a clear call to action: If you have a specific question or topic you want to discuss, make sure you give the other person a clear call to action. For example, you could say something like, ""Hey, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. What do you think?""
4. Respect people's boundaries: If someone doesn't want to engage in a conversation with you, it's important to respect their boundaries. Don't pressure them or keep sending messages if they don't respond.
5. Try different platforms: If you're finding that people aren't responding to","Hello there! 😊

921,How do I learn to let go of past problems and live one day at a time?,I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.,social-relationships,"Staying present is an attitude most of us aspire to, and most of us have to work at it—certainly at first. I’m here to tell you that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn. Unfortunately, the only way to do it is to do it. What a paradox! But there are plenty of other skills that we are not born with: walking on stilts, riding a bike, swimming, and driving a car are good examples. You can’t learn them by reading about them.Having said that, I can recommend two books on the subject: Eckhart Tolle’s The Power of Now and David Richo’s When the Past is Present. Richo asks that we don’t beat ourselves up about dwelling on past events. This is nature’s way of reminding us that we have unfinished business. But while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives, we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits us.He offers three helpful steps to making any important life change:Step One: Hold in awareness the behavior, belief, attitude, or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you want to be different. Awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffing.Step Two: Live as if you have already made the change. (This is hard and takes courage, but you can do it. Ride that bike—even if for a foot or two.)Step Three: Be persistent. (Practice, practice, practice.)Just as two-year-olds are able to walk confidently after hundreds of hours of practice, you’ll be able to stay in the here and now as long as you want after trying and failing many, many times.",2,383,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

924,My friends accusing me of having problems,They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,social-relationships,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!",1,144,"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>

###User: They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for reaching out about this challenging situation. It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and hurt when someone is calling you names, especially when they are behaving in a similar manner.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that people's behavior is often a reflection of their own emotions and experiences. It's possible that the person calling you names is struggling with their own issues and is projecting their feelings onto you.

Rather than internalizing their hurtful words, try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. You could try saying something like, ""I understand that you may be feeling upset or frustrated, and I'm here to listen and support you. However, I don't think it's fair or respectful to call me names. Can we find a more constructive way to communicate and resolve any issues?""

It's also important to set clear boundaries and communicate your expectations to the person. Let them know that you will not engage in name-calling or disrespectful behavior, and that you expect to be treated with respect and kindness.

Remember, you don't have to accept or tolerate behavior that is hurtful or disrespectful. You deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and it's okay to stand up for yourself and set boundaries.

Remember to take care of yourself and seek support from people who are positive and uplifting. You don't have to go through this alone, and there are many resources available to help you navigate difficult situations.

Remember, you are not alone and you don't have to face this situation alone. Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support.","Thank you for reaching out about this challenging situation.

###User: Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?###You: [/INST]  Thank you for asking! It's completely normal for people to feel emotional and tearful during therapy sessions. Therapy is a safe and supportive space for individuals to process and express their emotions, and it's common for people to experience a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and relief.

It's important to remember that therapy is not just about ""fixing"" problems, but also about creating a space for individuals to explore and understand their emotions and experiences. Tears can be a natural response to the emotional release that can occur during therapy, and they do not necessarily indicate that someone is ""broken"" or ""crazy.""

In fact, research has shown that emotional expression and release can be beneficial for mental health and well-being. Tears can help individuals process and release emotions, and can also serve as a sign of emotional release and catharsis.

If you find yourself feeling emotional or tearful during therapy, it's important to communicate this to your therapist. They are trained to work with individuals who are experiencing a range of emotions, and they can help you process and support you through your emotions.

Don't be afraid to communicate your feelings to your therapist, and know that they are there to support you every step of the way.","Thank you for asking!
