0,Do I have too many issues for counseling?,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",depression,"It is very common for people to have multiple issues that they want to (and need to) address in counseling.  I have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration, there is often an underlying fear that they  ""can't be helped"" or that they will ""be too much for their therapist."" I don't know if any of this rings true for you. But, most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not,  people have numerous significant stressors in their lives.  Let's face it, life can be complicated! Therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session. Most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress.  You can never have too many issues to address in counseling.  All of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling.",3,1971," It is not uncommon for individuals to have multiple issues they want to address in counseling, and it is absolutely possible to work on more than one issue at a time. However, it is important to keep in mind that counseling is a process that can take time, and it may be helpful to prioritize the issues that are causing you the most distress or impacting your daily life the most significantly.
It might be helpful to work with a therapist who specializes in trauma and PTSD, as they will have experience working with individuals who have experienced sexual abuse. Additionally, many therapists offer individual and group counseling sessions, so you may want to explore which option works best for you.
In terms of addressing your depression and anxiety, it can be helpful to work with a therapist who practices cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), as this approach focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to mental health issues.
It is also important to keep in mind that counseling is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it may take some time to find the right therapist who is a good fit for you. It can be helpful to ask questions about their experience working with individuals with similar issues, as well as their approach to counseling and how they see you addressing your issues in sessions.
Ultimately, it is important to prioritize your mental health and seek help if you are struggling with any of these issues. With the right support and resources, it is absolutely possible to make progress and improve your overall well-being."
2,I feel like my mother doesn't support me,My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.    She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me.    How can I get her to understand?,depression,"Do you live with your mom and have constant interaction with her?  It is your choice who you share things with.  You can set some clear boundaries.  She can either talk about the interest you feel comfortable or you can reduce, eliminate conversations with her.  These arguments are most likely not good for your depression.  Here is a video regarding boundaries.  Boundaries",2,187," It sounds like you are in a difficult situation, and it's understandable that you would want your mother to understand and respect your boundaries. However, it's important to remember that you cannot control how your mother behaves or feels, but you can control how you respond to her. Here are some suggestions that may help:
1. Communicate directly and calmly: When your mother starts an argument with you, try to remain calm and communicate directly with her. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid getting defensive or aggressive. For example, you could say, ""Mom, I understand that you're concerned about me, but I don't want to talk about my depression right now. Can we find another time to talk?""
2. Set boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries with your mother, especially if she's not been supportive in the past. Let her know how you feel and what you need from her in order to maintain a healthy relationship. For example, you could say, ""Mom, I appreciate your concern, but I need some space right now. Can we talk about something else for a while?""
3. Seek support elsewhere: If your mother is not being supportive, it may be helpful to seek support from other people in your life, such as friends, family members, or a therapist. This can help you feel more connected and less isolated.
4. Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself can help you feel more resilient in the face of challenging relationships. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.
Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries, even if they are different from what your mother wants or expects. With time, patience, and support, you may be able to find a more positive and respectful dynamic in your relationship."
11,Why am I experiencing dfficulty maintaining an erection?,"A few years ago I was making love to my wife when for no known reason I lost my erection,    Now I'm In my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent. This is causing major problems for my ego and it's diminishing my self esteem. This has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage.    I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to.    What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?",depression,"When I'm working with men with this type of situation, I always suggest a medical examination to rule out any type of organic reason for a difficulty in maintaining interaction. In cases where there is no medical reason for the loss of erection, I find that many men have a similar situation in experiencing negative intrusive thinking during lovemaking. My counseling approach for this situation is to incorporate the use of mindful sex.",1,194," It's important to understand that erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common issue that affects men of all ages, and it can have both physical and psychological causes. Here are some potential reasons why you might be experiencing ED:
1. Physical causes: There are many physical factors that can contribute to ED, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, prostate surgery or radiation therapy, and certain medications. It's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.
2. Psychological causes: Stress, anxiety, depression, and other psychological factors can also contribute to ED. If you are experiencing emotional distress or mental health issues, it may be affecting your ability to achieve and maintain an erection.
To address the issue of ED, here are some steps you can take:
1. Consult with a urologist: A urologist can help determine the underlying cause of your ED and recommend appropriate treatment options.
2. Address psychological factors: If you believe that psychological factors may be contributing to your ED, consider seeking therapy or counseling to address these issues.
3. Explore medication options: There are several medications available that can help treat ED, including sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra). These medications work by increasing blood flow to the penis, which can help achieve and maintain an erection.
4. Consider vacuum constriction devices: Vacuum constriction devices are devices that are placed over the penis and use suction to increase blood flow and help achieve an erection.
5. Explore penile injections: Penile injections involve injecting a medication into the penis to help achieve an erection.
6. Consider penile implants: If other treatments have been unsuccessful, penile implants may be an option. These devices are surgically implanted and can help achieve and maintain an erection.
It's important to note that ED can also be a sign of other underlying health issues, so it's important to consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any potential causes. Additionally, addressing the psychological factors contributing to ED can also help improve overall mental"
14,Can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?,"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?",depression,"Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it"" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC",2,5423," It sounds like you are struggling with some pretty intense feelings of low self-worth and hopelessness. It is important to know that these feelings do not define you, and there are many resources available to help you work through them.
Firstly, it's important to recognize that these feelings are not uncommon, and many people experience similar emotions at some point in their lives. It's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean that there is anything inherently wrong with you.
One thing that can be helpful is to try to identify the sources of these feelings. Are there specific events or experiences that are contributing to how you are feeling? Are there any negative self-thoughts or beliefs that are perpetuating these emotions? Once you have a better understanding of what might be driving your feelings, you can start to work on challenging and reframing these thoughts.
Another important step is to reach out for support. Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional can provide you with a safe space to process your emotions and work through them. It can also be helpful to connect with others who have experienced similar feelings, as this can help you feel less alone and more supported in your journey.
Finally, it's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being. This might involve engaging in self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. It could also involve seeking out professional help, such as therapy or counseling, which can provide you with additional support and guidance as you work through these challenging emotions.
Remember, you are not alone in this, and there is help available to you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need support."
16,How can I stop treating people badly?,"I feel like I'm so alone. I treat people horribly based on what's going on in my life and don't realize it. It ends up pushing them away, especially the ones I love the most. I have a weird feeling deep down inside, and it won't go away. I feel like I'm collapsing.",depression,"Give yourself a little more credit for self-observation!You wrote about treating people horribly and not realizing it.  Only if you truly didn't realize what you were doing, then you wouldn't be able to write about it.A little self-examination goes a long way.You have some basic clues about yourself, such as pushing people away whom you love.Start with reflecting on the reasons for your behavior, especially any fears about a negative result from opening your heart to another person.The weird feeling you have is also an area to self-reflect and theorize about.  From what you write, you have a solid awareness of your feelings.  This is the place to start understanding more about your hesitation in relationship with others.  This type of work can be done alone or with a therapist.",1,1029," It sounds like you are struggling with some difficult emotions and thoughts, and it can be challenging to navigate these feelings on your own. It's important to recognize that you are not alone in this struggle, and there are resources available to help you cope with these feelings and work towards healing.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you are not treating people horribly on purpose. It's possible that you are acting out of habit or as a coping mechanism without realizing the impact it has on those around you. This is why it's essential to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who can work with you to identify these patterns and develop healthier ways of dealing with your emotions.
Secondly, it's important to address the underlying feelings that are causing you to feel so alone. It sounds like there may be some deep-seated emotional pain or trauma that is contributing to these feelings of isolation. Working with a therapist can help you explore these issues and develop coping strategies to manage them in a healthy way.
Lastly, it's important to practice self-care and prioritize your own well-being. This may involve taking time for yourself each day, engaging in activities that bring you joy, and setting boundaries with others to protect your emotional energy. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone, and there are many resources available to help you work through these challenges.
In summary, it's important to recognize that you are not treating people horribly on purpose, but rather as a coping mechanism for deeper emotional pain. It's essential to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who can work with you to identify these patterns and develop healthier ways of dealing with your emotions. Additionally, prioritizing self-care and practicing self-compassion can go a long way in helping you manage these feelings of isolation and work towards healing."
17,How do depression and PMS symptoms contribute to one another and what can I do about it?,"I struggle with depression as well as pretty intense mood swings throughout the month. I experience highs where I feel amazing and energetic and then lows where I lack focus, energy, and generally have a more dark outlook on my life. How can I live a more balanced life?",depression,"Depression and PMS symptoms can be so hard to navigate !  Looking at this from a holistic standpoint can help you understand why you get these mood swings and what to do to balance yourself emotionally during this time. As a woman, we experience peaks and dips during our hormonal cycles and right before menstruation, we tend to feel not ourselves and down. The bloating and extreme cravings do not help either.Making sure your schedule is light and you have things to assist you can be so helpful. Different essential oils like lavender may calm you down, or orange which can uplift your mood. Homeopathy can be effective and gentle during this time as well. Birth control is known to help reduce the extreme spikes in hormones and can reduce your emotional and physical pain. Perhaps even psychiatric medication like an SSRI can help . If you are interested in going down the medication route, be sure to ask the doctor about potential side effects and risks . Reducing your processed sugar intake may help a lot as well. Exercising, spending time outside, practicing stress management and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can all be useful as well.",0,211," It's great that you are looking to manage your depression and mood swings better! Living a more balanced life can be achieved through various strategies and techniques. Here are some suggestions:
1. Practice self-care: Make time for activities that help you relax and recharge, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing yoga or meditation.
2. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help reduce symptoms of depression by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Find activities that you enjoy and aim to do them at least 3 times a week.
3. Connect with others: Social support is crucial for managing depression. Reach out to friends and family members, or join a support group to connect with others who understand what you're going through.
4. Set realistic goals: Break down larger goals into smaller, achievable steps. This can help you feel more in control of your life and reduce feelings of overwhelm.
5. Seek professional help: If you're struggling with depression or mood swings, consider consulting a mental health professional. They can provide you with additional coping strategies and support.
Remember, living a balanced life takes time and effort, but it is worth it in the long run. Be patient with yourself and keep practicing these strategies until they become second nature to you. Good luck!

33,Why do I feel like I will never have a good career/amount to anything financially?,"I'm in my early 20s. I've worked since two months after I turned 18. I have “plans.” I could become an electrician, or I could operate heavy machinery. I have goals, but I do nothing to try to meet them because I don't feel I can. I just want a better life for my fiancée and the kids than I did.",depression,"If you're not following the goals you gave yourself, there are two possibilities.You don't really like your goals.You self-sabotage and prevent yourself from your own strengths and accomplishments.Think through each of these.If you've set goals which aren't true to your nature, then intuitively some part of you will reject them.If you self-sabotage, get in your own way from achieving what you truly would like, then ask questions of yourself around whether you feel undeserving of success.",1,104," It sounds like you are feeling stuck in your current situation and unsure of how to move forward towards achieving your goals.

I have no extended family support. Often times, I feel overwhelmed, tired, and joyless. I feel out of control, sad and depressed on a daily basis.

53,How can I find myself again?,"I just don't know what I want in life anymore. I'm can't figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused. I can't put things into perspective at all. I'm just stuck, and I'm disappointed with my lack of accomplishments.",depression,"If you are a people-pleaser type or a natural caretaker, you can slowly ""lose yourself"" over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself.  If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot.  Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to ""take care of everything"" because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly. Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own.  You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well; if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don't create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you.  If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, it's easy to re-create this in adult relationships.In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this ""self sacrifice at the expense of others"" is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretaker/enabler/people-pleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self.  Basically, you spend so much time helping other people that you don't make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment.  Before you realize it, you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are.  Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable, but if you are always that person that rescues, those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them.  In conclusion, learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life.  It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now.  Take one small step at at a time.  Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy, and limit your contact and/or set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soul-searching.  Meanwhile, engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with, get yourself outside in the fresh air, get some good sleep, and eat some nourishing food!",0,203," It sounds like you are feeling pretty lost and uncertain about your future right now. It's totally normal to feel this way sometimes in life, especially when we are facing big changes or challenges. It can be really hard to figure out what we want to do with our lives, especially if we have a lot of responsibilities or distractions that make it hard for us to focus on the things that are important to us.
One thing you might try is to take some time to reflect on your values and priorities. What are the things in life that really matter to you? What do you stand for, and what do you want to achieve? Sometimes just taking a little bit of time each day to think about these things can help us get back on track and figure out what we really want to do with our lives.
Another thing you might try is to break down your big goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of trying to figure out everything all at once, just focus on one small thing that you can do each day or each week that will help you move closer to where you want to be. This can make things feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment and progress.
It's also important to remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and to ask for help along the way if you need it. Whether it's talking to friends or family members, or seeking out professional counseling or coaching, there are lots of resources available to help us figure out what we want to do with our lives and how to make it happen.
So don't be too hard on yourself right now. Just take things one step at a time, and try to focus on the things that really matter to you. And remember, it's okay to ask for help along the way if you need it!"
70,My parents are getting a divorce and I feel depressed,I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,depression,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen",0,241," It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of stress and sadness right now, and it's completely understandable that you would feel overwhelmed and want to escape.

Firstly, I would encourage you to talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling. This could be a parent, a teacher, or a close friend. Talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can be a great way to process and cope with difficult emotions.
Additionally, there are many resources available to help you manage your depression and anxiety. You might consider talking to a therapist or counselor, who can provide you with support and guidance on how to cope with these feelings. There are also many hotlines and online resources available, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (in the US) or the Samaritans (in the UK), which can provide you with immediate support and help.

109,I think I have anxiety and depression. It has manifested an extreme distrust for others,"My husband and I are in a terrible place. Part of me wants to fix it, but then I'm caught up with not knowing how and not being able to communicate my feelings to him because he always feels I'm blaming him. Sometimes I am because the feelings of distrust are so strong. I feel they must be coming from something he's doing, but sometimes I know I'm being irrational. Still, that doesn't stop the anxiety. The other half of the time, I just want to walk away, but I feel like that will only be a temporary fix.",depression,"You may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship.  This is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of you.Has he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you, is contributing to problems in the couple?Is he willing to understand what you're asking of him, without shutting down with whatever he is feeling when he feels blamed?Your feelings of distrust are the natural outcome of not being properly heard and understood.  He's not willing to listen to you, so of course you're frustrated and this frustration comes out in all sorts of uneasy feelings.Willingness to hear each other in a non-defensive way, sometimes requires a couples therapist's assistance.Ask your husband if he's willing to understand, not judge you.  Be willing yourself to do the same.If after trying and getting nowhere, you'll know when to stop trying on your own as a couple and to find a specifically trained couples therapists.Warning, not all therapists are trained to do couples therapy.  Ask the therapist if they've had specialized training in couples therapy.Otherwise, having a referee type therapy session of, ""what do you think"", ""what do you think?"", isn't going to do anything except frustrate both of you further.Good luck!",1,169," It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of emotional turmoil in your relationship with your husband, and it can be challenging to navigate these feelings on your own. Communication is key in any relationship, and it's important to find ways to express your feelings and concerns to your husband in a constructive way.
One approach you could try is to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about how you are feeling. It's important to be specific about the behaviors or actions that are causing you distrust, rather than generalizing or blaming him. For example, you could say something like ""Hey husband, I've been feeling really upset lately because of X, Y, and Z. Can we talk about what's going on and find a way to work through this together?""
It's also important to listen to your husband's perspective and try to understand where he is coming from. It may be that there are things he could be doing differently to help improve the situation, or it may be that there are underlying issues that need to be addressed.
Another option you could consider is seeking the help of a couples therapist or counselor. A professional can provide a safe and neutral space for both you and your husband to work through your feelings and concerns, and offer tools and strategies for improving communication and building trust in your relationship.
Ultimately, it's important to remember that relationships take work and effort from both parties. It may be challenging at times, but with open communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to listen and learn from each other, you can work towards finding a more positive and fulfilling place in your relationship."

Really ask yourself, ""are they facts?"" or are they your perspective on events.  In regards to your coping behaviours at night, it sounds very isolating and also very silenced.  As opposed to the sad music, why not try all music, allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you.  One of the other recommendations I would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way. Some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant, though and I would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future.",1,195," It sounds like you're struggling with some difficult emotions and behaviors lately. It can be really tough when we feel like we've lost our friends or that we're not being ourselves. It's important to remember that it's okay to feel this way, and that you don't have to go through it alone.
First of all, let me say that it's completely normal to feel sad or upset when someone close to us dies. It can be really hard to adjust to life without them, and it's okay to take some time to grieve. However, if you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling with your emotions for a long time, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about how you're feeling. They can help you process your emotions and find healthy ways to cope with them.
Regarding the cutting, I would strongly advise against it. Self-harm is not a healthy way to deal with difficult emotions, and it can lead to some serious physical and mental health problems if you continue to engage in it. Instead, try to find other ways to express your feelings and cope with them in a healthy way. For example, you could try talking to someone about how you're feeling, or finding a creative outlet like drawing or writing.
It's also important to remember that you don't have to fake a smile at school. It's okay to take some time for yourself and focus on your own well-being. You can try talking to a trusted teacher or counselor about how you're feeling, or finding a supportive friend who will listen to you and help you through this tough time.
Remember that you don't have to go through any of this alone. There are people who care about you and want to help you through it. Don't be afraid to reach out for support when you need it."
126,"My ex-boyfriend is with someone new, and it hurts","I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me ""I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,"" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasn't attractive, I wasn’t beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. I'm still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasn't good enough and that I'm no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but don't know if I should.",depression,"I am very sorry for the pain you are suffering. Losing the most significant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death. There will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside. With that being said, seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous support may be necessary for healing to take place. Anytime sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it is important to get help immediately. A therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going through, while also working with you to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals for your future. While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task, it will only make things easier and give you a sense of hope and purpose for your future. With the new year right around the corner, this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals related to living a more fullfilling life. Hang in there. With a support system in place and a healthy mindset, things can only get easier. Best of luck to you!",3,147," It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of pain and confusion after your recent breakup with your ex-boyfriend. It's understandable that you still have feelings for him, especially since you were in a close relationship for two years. However, it's important to recognize that his behavior towards you was not acceptable, and it's okay to feel hurt and angry about it.
It's important to take care of yourself during this time. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies. They can also provide support and guidance as you navigate this difficult time.
In terms of stopping the pain and moving on, it may be helpful to focus on self-care and self-compassion. Practice self-kindness, engage in activities that bring you joy, and try to reframe your thoughts about yourself and the breakup. Instead of beating yourself up over not being good enough or feeling unattractive, try to cultivate a sense of self-worth and self-acceptance.
It's also important to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs and feelings. If you find that his presence in your life is causing you more pain than happiness, it may be necessary to distance yourself from him or limit your contact with him. This can be a difficult decision, but it may be necessary for your own healing and well-being.
Remember, healing from a breakup takes time and patience. Be kind to yourself, focus on your own growth and development, and try not to compare yourself to others or dwell on the past. Instead, focus on the present moment and the future you want to create for yourself."

We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.",depression,"Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.",1,113," It sounds like you're struggling with some tough emotions right now, Boise. Losing someone you loved can be incredibly difficult, and it's okay that you're still feeling the sting of the breakup. It's important to give yourself time to grieve and heal, rather than trying to push through your feelings too quickly.
It's also understandable that you feel like you have no real friends, especially if you've been focusing on this one person for so long. However, it's important to remember that you don't need just one person to make you feel complete. You can find happiness and fulfillment in other areas of your life too.
One thing you might consider is reaching out to others who share similar interests or hobbies as you. This could be a great way to meet new people and form connections that aren't based on just one person. You could also try joining a club or group related to something you enjoy, like a sports team, book club, or volunteer organization. These types of groups can provide opportunities to meet new people and make friends in a low-pressure setting.
Another thing you might want to consider is practicing self-care and prioritizing your own needs and feelings. This could involve taking time for yourself each day to do something that makes you happy, like reading, writing, or listening to music. It could also involve talking to a therapist or counselor about how you're feeling and getting support in processing your emotions.
Remember, it's okay to feel sad or upset after a breakup, but it's important to take care of yourself and find ways to move forward in a positive way. You deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and there are plenty of people and things in life that can help you get there."

How can I be truly happy?",depression,"The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you have.You don't have to accept these words to describe who you are.A lot of mental health in our country is about telling people what's wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions, instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisions.You can be happy because nothing from the outside, such as the names people have used to tell you who you are, can interfere with your own wish to be happy.Others can slow you down because of the self-doubt and hurt feelings.  No one can take happiness from you, only they can make it harder to find and hold onto.Anger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approach.Think of the reason you are angry.  This will be better to know so you will be able to address it.Then you will not have anger to manage.",1,193," It's great that you are seeking help for your mental health concerns! Managing anger is a common challenge for individuals with ADHD, as well as those with other mental health conditions like bipolar disorder and ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). Here are some strategies that may help you manage your anger and improve your overall happiness:
1. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help calm you down when you feel angry or upset. You can also try yoga or tai chi to help you relax and focus on your breath and body movements.
2. Identify triggers: Keep a journal or log of when you feel angry or upset, and what might have triggered those feelings. Once you identify your triggers, you can develop strategies to avoid or cope with them. For example, if you get angry when you're tired or hungry, make sure to get enough sleep and eat regular meals.
3. Use positive self-talk: When you feel angry, try using positive self-talk to calm yourself down. Tell yourself that everything will be okay, and that you can handle the situation.
4. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness involves paying attention to your thoughts and feelings without judgment. When you feel angry, try practicing mindfulness by focusing on your breath or a calming phrase, such as ""I am calm and relaxed.""
5. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your anger management challenges. They can offer emotional support and help you develop strategies to manage your anger.
6. Consider therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a helpful approach for managing anger and other mental health conditions. A therapist can work with you to identify negative thought patterns and behaviors, and teach you new ways of thinking and acting that promote happiness and well-being.
7. Take care of yourself: Make sure to get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and eat a healthy diet. Taking care of your physical health can help improve your mental well-being and reduce feelings of anger.

I don't know how to talk to my parents about it.,depression,"Are you a teen?  This is a really hard problem for more teens (and adults) than let on.  When I was about 15, I remember asking my parent's friend, Herman, whether life gets any easier when you get older.  He said the problems are actually harder, but you gain the ability to deal with them better.  I've been an adult a long time now, and that is so true. If you need someone to talk to, consider a teacher or a school guidance counselor or someone you respect, maybe in church.  If they're good and they don't know how to help you, they may know how to get you to someone who can.  Also, the idea of not being ""good enough"" is a common psychological event.  In CBT it's called a ""core belief,"" but I call it a ""core lie"" in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  If you are serious about changing yourself, read about it  at www.LivingYes.org and pick up a copy there or on Amazon.  I hope this was helpful.  The future is filled with possibility if we don't prejudge it!  ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org)",0,252," It sounds like you are struggling with feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, which can be very challenging to deal with on a daily basis.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it's completely understandable that you might feel hesitant or scared about bringing this topic up with your parents. It's natural to worry about how they will react or what their response might be. However, it's important to remember that your parents are there to support and help you, and they want the best for you.
One way to approach this conversation with your parents is to be honest and direct about how you're feeling. You could say something like, ""Mom and Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind lately. I've been feeling really down and struggling with feelings of inadequacy. It's hard for me to deal with this stuff on my own, and I think I could use some help from you guys. Can we talk about it together?""
It might also be helpful to prepare for the conversation by thinking about what you want to say and how you want to say it. You could even write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal or on a piece of paper beforehand, so that you have something to refer to during the conversation.

 I get into these depressed like states whenever anyone I care about is too busy to be with me. I know that I shouldn't act like that because people are genuinely busy, but I feel like they're doing it just because they don't want to be around me.",depression,"Frequently when working with clients, I utilize the A-B-C model developed by Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory. The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an example:A (Action or Event): You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B (Behavior or Response): You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C (Consequence): You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend ""Feeling better, getting better, staying better"" by Alber Ellis. In addition, looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone.",6,218," It sounds like you may have experienced some significant emotional trauma in your past relationships, which has led to feelings of low self-worth and a fear of being abandoned or rejected by those close to you. This can manifest in various ways, such as pushing people away before they can hurt you or becoming depressed when someone is too busy to spend time with you.
To start working on improving yourself, it may be helpful to seek out therapy or counseling from a mental health professional. They can provide you with a safe and supportive space to explore the root causes of your feelings and develop coping strategies to manage them in a healthy way. Additionally, practicing self-care and prioritizing your own emotional well-being can be crucial in this process.

This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change, such as the recent death of a loved one, a lost relationship, or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this, what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle life’s ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. “You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.” Another quote I like is “You will find a way or you will find an excuse.” Don’t ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing, but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you, you will find a way. Don’t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical health, but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself. Also, find a meditation that works for you. There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises, visual and mental meditations, and many many more. Start making some positive changes in your life today! You can do it!",2,310," It can be challenging to overcome anxiety and social isolation due to various factors. Firstly, these issues may stem from underlying mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders, which can make it difficult to engage in social interactions and maintain relationships. Additionally, past traumatic experiences or negative messages received during childhood can contribute to feelings of low self-esteem and a lack of confidence in social situations.
Another factor that can hinder overcoming anxiety and social isolation is the tendency for people to avoid situations that may trigger these feelings. For instance, someone who has experienced bullying or rejection in the past may avoid social gatherings or events where they might encounter similar experiences. This avoidance can create a vicious cycle of isolation, which can further exacerbate anxiety and depression.
Fortunately, there are various strategies and therapies that can help individuals overcome anxiety and social isolation. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common approach used to address these issues by identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with anxiety and depression. Exposure therapy, which involves gradually exposing oneself to feared situations or stimuli, can also be effective in reducing anxiety and improving social interactions.
In addition, mindfulness practices such as meditation and deep breathing can help individuals become more aware of their thoughts and emotions, allowing them to better manage feelings of anxiety and depression. Finally, building a support network of friends, family, or mental health professionals can provide valuable encouragement and guidance throughout the process of overcoming anxiety and social isolation.
In summary, overcoming anxiety and social isolation requires addressing underlying issues such as mental health conditions, past traumas, and negative self-talk. By utilizing various strategies and therapies, individuals can gain greater control over their thoughts and emotions, leading to improved mental health and more fulfilling social interactions."

145,Thoughts of afterlife causes anxiety,"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.",anxiety,"You might be surprised how normal you are. Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you - it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die - regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our day-to-day anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown.  Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety. Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment - the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die. Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and can't get to sleep.

146,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,anxiety,"Hi there, Thank you for your question. It's absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy. I have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist. There can be a few reasons why you might feel this way. First, it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger. You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with him/her. Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children, we might have bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might bully or ridicule us, and that experience can stay with us for a long time, making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this the case, as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists, this anxiety will subside with time and you will re-learn that it is safe to share. And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult. Regardless of the reason, it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist.",3,2910," It is completely normal to feel nervous or shaky when starting therapy, especially if you are not used to talking about your feelings or experiences with strangers. The initial sessions of therapy can be a bit overwhelming as you get to know the therapist and start sharing personal information. However, as you continue to attend sessions, you will likely become more comfortable and open up more in the sessions. It is important to remember that therapy is a process and it may take some time for you to feel completely at ease. But with time, patience, and consistency, you can work through your challenges and develop greater self-awareness and emotional resilience. So, don't worry if you still feel nervous or shaky during sessions - it is normal and will likely subside as you continue to work through your issues with the therapist."

Good luck with your healing journey!",0,324," It sounds like you may be experiencing some form of self-soothing behavior, which is a common coping mechanism for people who have experienced trauma or stress in their lives. Hitting your head on walls and floors could be a way of releasing tension or anxiety in a physical way. However, it's important to recognize that this behavior is not a healthy or productive way to manage your emotions, and it can actually make things worse by causing physical harm or discomfort.
One way to help yourself change this behavior is to find alternative ways to cope with your anxiety and stress. Here are some suggestions:
1. Practice relaxation techniques: There are many different relaxation techniques that you can try, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery. Find a quiet space where you can sit comfortably and focus on slow, deep breaths. Try to relax each muscle group in turn, starting with your face and moving down to your toes.
2. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can be a great way to release tension and improve your mood. Find an activity that you enjoy, such as walking, running, or yoga, and make it a regular part of your routine.
3. Use positive self-talk: Whenever you notice yourself hitting your head, try to stop and take a few deep breaths instead. Tell yourself that you are safe and that you can handle whatever is causing you stress.
4. Seek support from friends or family: Talking to someone you trust about how you're feeling can be a great way to get support and find new ways to cope with your emotions.
5. Consider seeking professional help: If you find that you are struggling to manage your anxiety and stress on your own, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can work with you to identify the underlying causes of your behavior and develop strategies for managing it in a healthy way.
Remember, changing a long-standing behavior like this can be difficult, but it is possible with patience, persistence, and support. Take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it."
151,Overcoming fears,"I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I don't know how. What can I do?",anxiety,"Fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance I'll use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said ""I'm scared of snakes"", I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C",1,612," Hello! It takes courage to acknowledge and confront your fears, and facing them head-on is often the best way to overcome them. Here are some steps you can take to face your fears:
1. Identify the source of your fear: Understanding where your fear comes from can help you address it more effectively. Is it a past experience or something you learned from others? Once you understand the source, you can start working on ways to overcome it.
2. Expose yourself gradually: One of the most effective ways to overcome fear is through gradual exposure. Start by exposing yourself to small doses of what you fear, and gradually increase the intensity or duration over time. For example, if you're afraid of public speaking, start by practicing in front of a small group of friends or family members, then work your way up to larger groups or even strangers.
3. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help calm your nerves and reduce anxiety when facing your fears. You can also try meditation or yoga to help you relax and focus.
4. Challenge negative thoughts: Often, our fears are fueled by negative self-talk or catastrophic thinking. Try to identify these patterns in yourself and challenge them with evidence to the contrary. For example, if you're afraid of failure, remind yourself of times when you succeeded or overcome challenges in the past.
5. Seek support: Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional can help you process your fears and develop strategies for overcoming them. They may also be able to provide emotional support during the process of facing your fears.
6. Take small steps: Don't try to tackle your biggest fears all at once. Start with smaller, more manageable goals, and gradually work your way up to bigger challenges. This will help you build confidence and momentum along the way.
7. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness involves being present in the moment and observing your thoughts without judgment. By practicing mindfulness, you can learn to observe your fears without getting caught up in them, which can help you overcome them more effectively.
8. Reframe your thinking: Try to see your fears as opportunities for growth rather than sources of anxiety. Viewing challenges as"

I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?",anxiety,"A good way to start is the language or ""self talk"" that is happening inside your mind.  Looking at your question, when it is said that the presentations ""make me feel stress"" you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self.  The presentations cannot give or take away your stress, that's something only you can do and you can do it!   What language can you change in your self talk?  For example, are you saying ""I can't speak in front of an audience! I'll fail?""  That sounds a lot different than ""I studied my butt off and if I practice speaking out loud, I can ace this presentation!""  Although this is a short answer, I do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence.",1,249," It sounds like you are on the right track. Recognizing these nagging thoughts of self-doubt as ""imposter syndrome"" is a huge step in the right direction. From what you have written here, it appears that you are able to challenge your own thoughts and provide yourself with evidence that counteracts the imposter syndrome. Continuing to remind yourself of what you have accomplished and looking at the facts at hand can help diminish doubt. Remember, many successful people battled imposter syndrome on the way to the top (and still manage it). It might be helpful to read some of their stories so that you don't feel alone. ""The Cut"" has a great article on ""25 Famous Women on Imposter-Syndrome and Self-Doubt"". Business Insider has a great article about men and the imposter syndrome too.

156,I want to feel more comfortable around people,"My son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and I stopped working so that I could take care of him. I also was dealing with an abusive relationship (mentally, physically, and emotionally). Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people.
   How can I feel more comfortable around other people?",anxiety,"There's a lot of layers there to your situation, and I'm focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others.  One layer is the daunting news that your son has autism.  Many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis.  The vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap one's head around.  Taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful.  Some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child, and others may experience guilt.  If either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you, it may be worth working through them with a therapist.  A support group list is available through www.autismspeaks.org and may help connect you with others raising children with autism.A second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in.  The trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others.  Engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process, as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships.",1,138," It's great that you are taking steps to prioritize your own well-being by stopping work to care for your son and leaving an abusive relationship. However, it's understandable that living with autism and experiencing trauma can make social interactions challenging. Here are some suggestions that may help you feel more comfortable around other people:
1. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough rest, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. This will help you feel more grounded and better equipped to handle social situations.
2. Join a support group: Connecting with others who have gone through similar experiences can be incredibly helpful. You can share tips, resources, and emotional support with each other.
3. Take small steps: Start by engaging in low-stakes interactions, such as chatting with a cashier or saying hello to a neighbor. Gradually work your way up to more challenging situations, like attending a social event or participating in a group activity.
4. Use visual aids: If you have autism, you may find it helpful to use visual aids like pictures or diagrams to communicate and understand better. You can also use visual schedules or checklists to help you stay organized and on track.
5. Seek professional help: Consider consulting with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders or autism spectrum disorder. They can provide you with additional coping strategies and support.
Remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace and prioritize your own needs. With time and practice, you can learn to feel more comfortable around other people."
160,How do I cope with separation anxiety while boyfriend is out of town?,"I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year. He recently got a new job and travels a lot. I’m not used to him being gone all the time. I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesn’t keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day, which he used to.
 I feel lost, sad and unwanted. This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I don’t know why he is acting this way lately. I believe I have separation anxiety. Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town?",anxiety,"Relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard! It makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship. And you're right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partner's interest. Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle you're feeling? It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners, but it really is possible. If you have any concerns about being able to do this, then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful - and it really can be just about finding the way to share what you're feeling.As far as coping with anxiety, there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called Self-Help for Anxiety Management.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that this is a difficult new challenge for both of you, and it may take some time for him to adjust to his new job and schedule. It's possible that he is simply prioritizing his work right now and may not have the same amount of time or energy to devote to our relationship as he did before.
That being said, there are a few things you can do to help cope with these feelings while he is away:
1. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by doing things that make you feel good, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends and family.
2. Stay connected: Even though your boyfriend is gone, try to stay in touch with him through phone calls, video chats, or messaging apps. This can help you feel more connected to him even when he's not physically present.
3. Focus on other relationships: Spend time with friends and family who can provide emotional support during this challenging time.
4. Seek professional help: If you are experiencing overwhelming sadness, anxiety, or other difficult emotions, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can provide you with additional coping strategies and support.

I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes.",anxiety,"This is a very common question in my practice. Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue (ex. Depression, low self-esteem, fears). To decrease your anxiety symptoms it’s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: ""I don't need to worry, I am calm and relaxed"". 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house; presenting in front of others; going to social events; and having conversations with people. However, the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills (ex. deep breathing) the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful. Keep in mind, a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement.",5,362," It sounds like you may be experiencing some level of social anxiety or insecurity about yourself and your abilities. This can manifest in feelings of nervousness or panic when interacting with others, or a general sense of unease about your own self-worth. It's important to remember that everyone experiences these feelings at times, and they are not necessarily reflective of your actual abilities or worth as a person.
One way to start addressing these feelings is to practice self-compassion and self-acceptance. This can involve treating yourself with kindness and understanding, rather than beating yourself up over perceived shortcomings. It can also help to challenge negative self-talk and replace it with more positive affirmations.
Another strategy is to focus on building your self-esteem and confidence through small, achievable goals. By setting and achieving these goals, you can gradually build your sense of self-worth and competence. This can help to reduce feelings of anxiety and insecurity over time.
Finally, consider seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional. Talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can be a powerful way to gain perspective and develop coping strategies for managing anxiety.

Remember that healing and moving on is a process that takes time, effort, and support. Be patient with yourself and seek out resources that can help you navigate this challenging situation."
255,My son plays alone at recess,Is this something I should be worried about? Should I do something about it?,parenting,"It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships. Parents can usually tell when their child is happy. But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment, perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner. Others may internalize symptoms, appearing sad or withdrawn. A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone. A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground, and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play, unsure of how to join the group. Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends. Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child, but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group Ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play. If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen, or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys, the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own. I encourage well-meaning parents to choose words carefully. Use phrases like, ""Hey, I noticed something,"" or ""Let me help you be successful."" By showing respect, parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zone.When to seek professional help. When does isolation raise a red flag for long-term issues? True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood. Still, professional counseling should be considered if the anti-social behavior is causing the child significant distress, perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities. Also, parents should pay attention to how the child's social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety. The vast majority of children who define ""quality time"" as time alone are perfectly happy, healthy and normal. If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship, exhibiting what experts call ""social reciprocity,"" then parents can relax, and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company.",3,1239," It is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter. I can’t offer advice without knowing much more about your particular situation but some things to think about:Has something else happen recently that has been stressful, upsetting?Is your daughter trying to communicate something to you and if so what might that be?Have you discussed these recent changes with her? (Without being too serious or accusatory)There is so much changing for her (and you) now-communication and connection are crucial.I hope you both can talk to a supportive person about all these changes."
256,My toddler wants her daddy to die when she's mad at him,"I told her that if daddy dies, we will never see him again. She started crying because I wouldn't make her daddy die.",parenting,"Children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately. It is also very likely that your daughter does not understand  the permanence of death. Having said that, she is using some very specific ideas here and I would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with children.I would also wonder where she is getting this idea. Sometimes children hear things on TV or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are remembering.It may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry, like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking for.I'm curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry. Does she say the same sorts of things about you?It may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional (possibly the same one who is working with your daughter) so that you can have some support with this as well.",2,412," It sounds like your daughter is struggling with the idea of losing her grandfather, and it's understandable given how close they are. It's important to validate her feelings and let her know that it's okay to be sad or scared about this possibility. Here are some things you could say to help her process this:
""I know you're feeling really upset about the idea of Grandpa dying, and I'm here to listen and support you. It's okay to feel sad or scared when we lose someone we love, because it can be very difficult. But even though Grandpa might die someday, we will always have happy memories of him, and he will always be in our hearts.""
You could also try to help her find ways to cope with this possibility, such as talking about their favorite memories together or finding ways to honor his life and legacy. It's important to be honest and open with your daughter, but also to be sensitive to her feelings and to reassure her that it's okay to feel scared or sad about this."
271,Is it normal to dislike one child?,I have three children. The oldest is nine and not my biological child. The middle child is three and the youngest is one. I have a great relationship with the oldest two children but I haven't developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child. I rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times. Is this normal?,parenting,"This is your experience, your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal, which means is this common or the rule. This question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis- turbed [etymology: agitated or stirred up].  Feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right.  So, though  it might be normal [common, the rule]  to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old, the dis- turbance or stirring up in you, is important and requires your attention, your listening, if you will to your higher self.",1,268," It is common for parents to develop different levels of attachment to their children, especially as they grow older. However, it is important to recognize that each child has their unique needs and personality, and to prioritize spending quality time with them all. While it's understandable that you may have a stronger connection with your oldest two children due to shared experiences and bonding, it's essential to make an effort to connect with the youngest child as well.
Here are some ways to foster a closer relationship with your youngest child:
1. Spend quality time together: Set aside dedicated time each day to spend with your youngest child, doing activities that they enjoy, such as reading, playing games, or going on outings.
2. Get involved in their interests: Show interest in the things that your youngest child enjoys, whether it's music, art, or sports. By showing support and enthusiasm for their passions, you can help strengthen your bond.
3. Create special traditions: Develop special traditions or rituals with your youngest child, such as a bedtime story or a special goodnight routine. These small moments can help create lasting memories and reinforce your connection.
4. Be present during nap time: While it may be tempting to use this time for personal activities, try to stay present and engaged during your youngest child's naps. Offer comfort or simply sit with them, enjoying their company.
5. Practice mindfulness: Take a step back and focus on the present moment when you're with your youngest child. Mindfulness practices can help you cultivate a greater sense of calm and connection with your child.
Remember, it's important to prioritize spending quality time with all of your children, even if you don't feel an immediate connection with the youngest one. With patience, consistency, and effort, you can develop a strong bond with each of them over time."
284,Should my step-daughters be told that their step-father has a child pornography addiction?,"My husband’s ex-wife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My step-daughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husband’s ex-wife has kept this information from my step-daughters. The step-father has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently. The ex-wife minimizes it by saying that he has ""repented."" It is a constant strain on my husband, knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography. My own therapist believes the girls should be told. The ex-wife says her therapist says the opposite.",parenting,If the daughters are old & mature enough to understand substance abuse.  They should be told for their own empowerment.

It's understandable that you and your husband are concerned about this situation, especially given the nature of the offense committed by the stepfather. Child pornography is a serious issue, and it's important to prioritize the safety and well-being of your stepdaughters.
While it's understandable that the ex-wife may want to protect her daughters from this information, it's important to consider their emotional well-being and long-term psychological impact of keeping this secret. Hiding or minimizing the issue can lead to further trauma and distress for everyone involved.
Given the severity of the stepfather's offense, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or child protective services to ensure the safety and well-being of your stepdaughters. A thorough investigation could help uncover any other potential threats to their safety and provide appropriate support and protection.
In the meantime, it's important to maintain open communication with your husband and stepdaughters about this situation. Encourage them to express their feelings and concerns in a safe and supportive environment. Offer emotional support and resources for healing and coping with this difficult situation.
Remember that you are not alone in this, and there are professionals and organizations available to help you and your family navigate these challenges. Don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it."
289,"My daughter calls me crazy, and I’m not sure how to handle that","I am divorced and happily remarried. Our blended family of children are in their 20s. My youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. He was abusive to me, and I left with injuries. He never wanted kids, and I did. He paid child support only through forced wage earners. Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom. I don’t deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. I’m not sure how to handle this.",parenting,"Hi Arkansas, Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. Your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. It's a form of woman abuse and child abuse. He's likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and he's not considering how it's affecting the kids. I've seen this happen in many families; parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. It's your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it. While you can't change his behaviours, and I think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids. For your children, you can refuse to enter into the war he's setting up. He's trying to provoke you into acting ""crazy"", but you don't have to fall for this. If you run around screaming ""he's lying!"", it only makes you look more 'crazy'. Try to stay calm, and don't put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. One day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesn't have the power to destroy their love for you. Children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already, I'd bet, but they don't know how to cope with that. If he's the only one fighting a war, you're helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Don't engage on his level. Don't blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don't need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their father's agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isn't the answer, but have compassion for their position. This picture isn't their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices.Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You don't need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that some day, they will come back and be grateful. It may take a while, you can't rush it, but they will see you for who you are. Your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on. I'd recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded. Good luck!",4,687," It sounds like you are dealing with some complex emotions and dynamics in your blended family. Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that it's completely normal for children to have a closer relationship with one parent over the other, especially if that parent was more involved in their upbringing. However, it's also important to recognize that this doesn't mean you are ""crazy"" or that your feelings are any less valid.
It sounds like your ex-husband's abuse has had a lasting impact on your relationship with your daughters, and it's understandable that you would want to protect yourself and set boundaries to maintain a healthy dynamic in the family. However, it's important to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding, rather than resorting to labeling or blaming language.
One strategy you could try is to have an open and honest conversation with your daughters about how their father's abuse has affected you and your relationship with them. This can help them understand why you may be more protective of yourself and set boundaries that feel necessary for your own well-being. It's important to communicate these feelings in a non-judgmental way, without placing blame or guilt on your daughters.
Additionally, it may be helpful to seek out therapy or counseling as an individual or as a family unit to work through these complex emotions and dynamics. A trained therapist can provide a safe space for everyone to express themselves and work towards healing and growth.
Remember that healing from abuse takes time, patience, and support. Be kind to yourself and prioritize your own well-being throughout this process."

You can also offer support and help facilitate communication between the two of them if they are willing to work towards a resolution.
It is important to prioritize the child's well-being and ensure that any decisions made about their interactions are in their best interests. It may be helpful to seek the advice of a mediator or counselor who can help facilitate a productive and respectful conversation between all parties involved.

It is important to communicate with your parents in a respectful and calm manner about how you are feeling, and to try to find a solution that works for everyone. It may be helpful to explain to them that having your partner there can provide emotional support during this time, and that it can also help to have him involved in the pregnancy and birth of their child.

It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy.

It is not uncommon for children to act out in ways that are harmful or hurtful to others, especially if they are experiencing stress or trauma in their lives. However, it is important to address these behaviors and work with the child to develop healthier coping mechanisms and problem-solving skills.
You have already taken some steps to address this behavior, such as using time-outs, spanking, and taking away toys. While these measures may help to reduce the behavior in the short term, they do not address the underlying issues that may be contributing to the child's behavior. It is important to work with a therapist or counselor who can help you and your stepchild identify the root causes of this behavior and develop strategies for managing it in a healthy and constructive way.
In addition, it is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of all children involved. If you are concerned about your daughter's safety or well-being due to her stepchild's behavior, you may want to consider seeking additional support from a social worker or other professional who can provide guidance and resources for addressing this situation.

We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. I used to party a lot, and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else. These situations were never more than just kissing. I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend, and he decided to forgive and move forward with me. I love him so much and want to work things out too, but I'm having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. I can't seem to forgive myself. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.",self-esteem,"Hi Cerritos,This is an interesting twist because it's more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness. You are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions. My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. You don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. You only have to have the maturity to recognise when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? Were you shamed as a child? Did you learn that you deserved to be punished? Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. The bar is too high for you. If I was your therapist, I would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound. If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself. Forgiving doesn't mean ""it was okay""; forgiving simply means that it happened, that you can't erase it, and that you don't want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore. You have done many things here that you can feel proud of! You've 'come clean', you've been honest, you've taken responsibility for your actions, you've not tried to minimize what you did, and you've chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend. These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. You are acting very honourably. It's time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that you've learned from them and are a better person now. It's not our mistakes...not our worst moments that define us...it's how we handle them afterwards.I wish you growth and happiness.",3,1015," It sounds like you have been through some challenging times in your relationship, and it takes a lot of courage to work through those issues together. Forgiveness is not always easy, especially when it comes to ourselves. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay to forgive yourself for past actions. Self-forgiveness can be a process, but it's essential to move forward in a positive way.
It's understandable that you may struggle with feelings of guilt or unworthiness after what happened in the past. However, it's important to remember that your boyfriend has chosen to forgive and work things out with you. His decision to do so is a testament to his love for you and his commitment to making your relationship work.
It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how you are feeling. Let him know that you appreciate his willingness to forgive you, but that you are still struggling with self-forgiveness. Together, you can work on finding ways to move forward in a positive way.
Additionally, it may be helpful to focus on the present and future rather than dwelling too much on the past. Make an effort to communicate openly and honestly with each other, and prioritize building trust and strengthening your relationship moving forward. With time, patience, and effort, you can work through these challenges together and build a stronger, healthier relationship."

It's important to recognize that you have different priorities and perspectives, and it may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your ex-partner about how you can work together to support your daughter while also respecting each other's boundaries.
One potential approach could be to focus on building a positive co-parenting relationship with your ex-partner, which can involve setting clear boundaries and expectations for how you will work together to raise your daughter. This may involve having open and honest conversations about your respective roles and responsibilities as parents, and finding ways to communicate effectively and respectfully even when you don't agree on everything.
It's also important to prioritize your own emotional wellbeing and to find healthy ways to manage any stress or tension that may arise in this situation. This could involve seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist, and finding activities and hobbies that bring you joy and help you stay grounded.
Ultimately, the most important thing is to prioritize your daughter's wellbeing and to find ways to work together as parents in a way that supports her emotional health and stability. By focusing on communication, respect, and cooperation, you may be able to find a way forward that works for everyone involved."

391,Why do I feel like I'm always wrong in everything in my relationship?,"My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that I'm doing things she finds disrespectful even when I don't mean it like that. For example, she gets offended when I call someone at work ""sweetheart."" I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her. She doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. How do I get her to understand?",workplace-relationships,"Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns. One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define ""infidelity"". Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, ""I feel you distancing from me."" In other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs. The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a ""sweetheart."" The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean ""you're so sweet and kind"", ""my dear"", or in a flirtatious manner to mean ""sweetie."" The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said.  If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, ""I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much."" Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying ""sweetheart"" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, ""I'm sorry."" However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says ""I'm sorry"", I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating. For more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469.",9,5987," It sounds like you are in a very difficult and frustrating situation. Your wife's constant accusations and lack of willingness to listen to your perspective can be incredibly draining on your relationship. Here are some suggestions that may help improve the communication between you and your wife:
1. Practice active listening: Make an effort to truly hear and understand your wife's concerns, even if you don't agree with them. Try to put yourself in her shoes and see things from her perspective. This can help prevent misunderstandings and defensiveness.
2. Avoid getting defensive: When your wife accuses you of cheating or being disrespectful, try not to get defensive or angry. Instead, listen to what she has to say and respond calmly and thoughtfully.
3. Use ""I"" statements: When expressing your thoughts and feelings, use ""I"" statements instead of blaming or attacking language. For example, you could say ""I feel hurt when you accuse me of cheating without any evidence"" rather than ""You're always accusing me of cheating and it's not fair.""
4. Focus on finding solutions: Instead of getting bogged down in accusations and blame, try to focus on finding solutions to the issues that are causing tension in your relationship. Ask your wife what she needs from you in order to feel respected and valued, and be open to hearing her perspective.
5. Seek outside help: If you're struggling to communicate effectively with your wife or if the situation is becoming too overwhelming, consider seeking outside help from a couples therapist or counselor. They can provide you with tools and strategies to improve communication and work through challenges in a safe and supportive environment.
Remember, improving communication and trust in a relationship takes time and effort from both parties. It's important to be patient, empathetic, and willing to listen and learn."

401,Is it unethical to have a relationship with a fellow counselor?,Does this go against any ethical codes? Are there legal ramifications?,workplace-relationships,"Generally, the ethical codes only prohibit relationships with clients. There are however a few types of counselor-to-counselor relationships that are prohibited by the ethics codes. Such prohibited relationships include those between supervisors and supervisees; between professors and students; or any time the relationship might negatively impact your (or their) clients. Lastly, some workplaces have rules against dating coworkers. It would be a good idea to check if there is such a rule that applies to you.",1,240," Yes, this does go against ethical codes and there are legal ramifications. The counselor's actions of borrowing money from a client and failing to pay it back is considered unethical behavior and could result in disciplinary action by the state regulatory board. Additionally, the counselor's failure to disclose their financial interest in the client could be seen as a violation of the American Counseling Association (ACA) Code of Ethics and the ethical principles outlined in the code. The ACA Code of Ethics states that counselors should avoid conflicts of interest and maintain appropriate boundaries with clients, which includes not engaging in financial transactions with clients without their informed consent.
It is important to note that the client's medical emergency may have affected their ability to make informed decisions about their finances, including loaning money to the counselor. In this case, it would be best for the client to seek legal advice and explore their options for seeking compensation for any losses incurred as a result of the counselor's actions."

Although everyone may not agree with one another, the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction. There are many families that are united despite their differences. For example, a mother may be Catholic and the father Jewish. By introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial. Also, it's not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences.

It's also important to take care of yourself during this time, both physically and emotionally. Make sure to get enough rest, eat well, and engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.

441,I'm falling for my abusive and cheating ex-boyfriend,"My kid’s dad and I broke up two years ago. He still wants me back, and I just started to fall for him again. But our kids are with Child Protective Services: that’s why we broke up. He started to talk to other women, and he put his hands on me.",domestic-violence,What you are experiencing is common with survivors of abusive relationships. Even abusive relationships have positive moments in them and typically for survivors those are things they still love and care about of the abuser. A lot of it could also be grief over the loss of the relationship and also your children. A lot of time people return to thier abuser because that’s the only support that they have. If this is something you are going through I would encourage you to seek out a domestic violence non profit in your area because they can provide you with additional support.  I don’t know the whole situation but keep in mind that abusers will make promises and say what they think the other person wants to hear to get them to return. Attached is an example of what I am talking about: http://www.bfwc.org/pdf/Cycle%20of%20Violence.pdfBased on what you decide I would encourage you to keep  caution and boundaries. It might be helpful to safety plan with a domestic violence non profit.,1,188," It's understandable that you may have feelings for your ex-partner again, especially after two years have passed since the breakup. However, it's important to remember that their behavior towards you during your relationship and after the breakup is not acceptable. They are still in contact with other women while they are in a custody battle with your children, which shows a lack of respect for boundaries and prioritizing their own desires over the well-being of your children.
It's important to remember that you have the right to prioritize your own safety and well-being, as well as that of your children. It may be helpful to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you process your feelings and navigate this difficult situation.
Additionally, it's important to remember that you are not alone in this situation. Many people have experienced similar situations where they feel drawn back to an ex-partner, only to realize that their partner is not willing or able to change their behavior. It may be helpful to seek out support groups or online communities where you can connect with others who have gone through similar experiences.
Remember, it's okay to take things slow and prioritize your own well-being. Don't feel pressured to rush into anything that doesn't feel right for you. You deserve to be in a healthy and respectful relationship, and it's important to prioritize your own safety and well-being above all else."
447,I want to stop physically abusing my girlfriend,"I have anger issues that have worsened over the years because I’ve never dealt with my emotions. My anger has never been expressed physically until the past year. My girlfriend has had to endure these episodes. I love her, and I think I’m about to lose her, if I already haven’t. I throw things at her when I’m angry, and sometimes I hit her. I may not hit her enough to cause harm, but I still physically lash out at her. I don’t want to lose her, and I don’t want the situation to worsen. I am a lesbian in my early 30s, and I have been dealing with anger since my childhood. I'm ready to change. I need help now. I'm about to explode.",domestic-violence,"Hi Baton Rouge,I'm glad you're reaching out. The first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours. I do hear you minimizing your actions (you say you don't ""hit her enough to cause harm""?), but you're headed in the right direction. I hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm you're causing isn't just superficial bruising. The effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds. Please seek treatment for yourself immediately.You say you love your girlfriend? Do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues? Are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partner?You have dangerous habits because you don't know how to manage your own emotional pain. You can unlearn this; and it doesn't mean you're a bad person. Sometimes, however, the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended, for both of your sakes, because too much damage has been done.I know you don't want to lose her, but you don't own her, and you don't have the right to trap her in this because you're afraid of being alone. Right now, she needs some space to figure out what's best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants. This is potentially the first step to learning real respect; honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort. I wish you well.",2,624," It sounds like you are experiencing some complex emotions that are causing your anger issues. It's important to recognize that your feelings of anger are not just a result of external factors, but also stem from deeper emotional issues. Here are some suggestions that may help you manage your anger and improve your overall well-being:
1. Practice self-awareness: Take time each day to reflect on how you are feeling and identify any triggers that may be causing your anger. This can help you anticipate and prepare for difficult situations.
2. Learn to express emotions in a healthy way: Instead of lashing out physically, try expressing your emotions in a more constructive way, such as through writing or talking to a trusted friend or therapist.
3. Develop a grounding technique: When you feel yourself getting angry, try engaging in an activity that helps you relax and focus on the present moment, such as deep breathing, yoga, or meditation.
4. Seek professional help: Consider working with a therapist who specializes in anger management. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your anger and develop strategies for managing it in a healthy way.
5. Set boundaries: If you find that certain people or situations trigger your anger, set boundaries to protect yourself. This may mean avoiding those people or situations or establishing clear limits on how you will engage with them.
Remember, managing anger is a process that takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and keep working towards your goals. With the right support and strategies in place, you can learn to manage your anger and improve your overall well-being."
451,I endured sexual and physical abuse by my brother as child,Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?,domestic-violence,"I will assume that for whatever reason, you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this. However, I highly urge you to do so because long-term childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult, as it seems you are already aware. There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse. Some/most also offer free counseling services in local areas. That would be a good place to start looking, especially if cost of counseling is an issue.The important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past. Having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you. Angry? Yes! At your brother for what he did, at your parents for not protecting you. Having trouble trusting? Of course! The very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead. Two books that might help you are Codependent No More and Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin.",2,190," It's great that you are taking responsibility for your emotions and wanting to work on them! Treating and fixing yourself requires self-awareness, self-care, and seeking professional help when needed. Here are some steps you can take:
1. Self-reflection: Take time each day to reflect on how you're feeling and identify any triggers that may be causing your anger or trust issues. Write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal or talk to a friend or therapist about them.
2. Practice self-care: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly. Taking care of your physical health can help improve your mental wellbeing.
3. Seek professional help: If you're struggling with anger or trust issues, consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your emotions and work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to these feelings.
4. Communication skills: Practice active listening and assertive communication with those around you. This can help improve your relationships and reduce conflicts caused by miscommunication or misunderstandings.
5. Mindfulness practices: Try incorporating mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, into your daily routine. These can help you stay present and focused in the moment, rather than getting caught up in negative emotions or thoughts about the past or future.
Remember, healing and growth take time and effort. Be patient with yourself and keep working towards your goals. Good luck!"
452,Why did my boyfriend hit himself in the face during an argument?,"When I got home, my boyfriend and I got into an argument. He got upset and he started hitting his face. That is the first time he has ever done that, but I would be lying if I said that didn't scare me. I locked myself in the room.",anger-management,"Sounds scary to watch.  I agree with you!Maybe he felt so overwhelmed by anger, hurt and frustration that he went back to an old behavior from his past in which someone hit him for having strong emotions.Now that the incident is past, bring up the topic to him so the two of you can discuss it.Just the fact of you having empathy and caring what he was feeling at the time, may be restorative to him.At the very least, you may find out exactly what the answer is to your question as to why he did this in the first place!",5,5404," It sounds like you are in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation. I strongly advise you to prioritize your safety above all else. If you are in immediate danger, please call emergency services or a domestic violence hotline for help. It is important to remember that you do not deserve to be abused or threatened in any way, and there are resources available to support you.
If you are unable to leave the situation immediately, consider reaching out to a trusted friend or family member for help. They may be able to provide emotional support or help you find a safe place to stay. Additionally, many organizations offer emergency shelter and other forms of support for victims of domestic violence.

469,I need to know how to cope with misophonia before I go completely insane,"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.",anger-management,"Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.",1,55," There are several things you can try to help reduce your anger towards the sounds of eating and breathing that give you headaches. Here are a few suggestions:
1. Practice relaxation techniques: When you feel yourself getting angry or frustrated, take a few deep breaths and try to relax. You can also try progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body.
2. Use earplugs or earmuffs: If the sounds of eating and breathing are causing headaches due to loud noises, consider using earplugs or earmuffs when you're in a situation where you can't avoid these sounds. You can also try playing white noise or calming music in the background to help mask the sounds.
3. Reframe your thinking: Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of the sounds, try to reframe your thinking around them. For example, instead of thinking ""I can't believe I have to listen to this snoring,"" try thinking ""This person is breathing in a way that is comfortable for them.""
4. Talk to someone: If you find yourself getting angry or frustrated about the sounds of eating and breathing on a regular basis, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about it. They can help you explore why these sounds are causing you so much distress and offer strategies for managing your emotions in these situations.
Remember that everyone has their own way of dealing with stressors like this, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It may take some experimentation to find what works best for you."
476,My husband and I can’t talk to each other without arguing,"Every time I speak, he says I anger him. Also, when he’s mad at something, like work, he gets angry at me. I feel like we’re so distant from each other now. We used to laugh all the time, and I feel like he lets too much negativity in. What should I do? We've been married for two years but together for seven.",anger-management,"Hi, Newark. It sounds to me like your husband is going through something, and I think you understand that. You might feel very helpless, sad, and disrespected at the same time. He's changed. It's unfair for him to blame you for his emotions. His mood issues are about him, not you, and he's either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it. Are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries? You can let him know when you feel disrespected, and what's not okay with you.He may be experiencing depression, which often shows up as irritability in men. It could be that he's not telling you something, or he's unaware of his emotional processes. You can try a ""I'm really worried about you. You don't seem happy and I don't know how to help you. Some things are happening that aren't okay with me. Will you see a therapist?"" approach. Perhaps you could go with him the first time?  It's about a combination of compassion, self-respect and seeking professional help, I believe. I wish you well.",1,259," It sounds like there are some significant issues in your relationship that need to be addressed. Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that communication is a crucial aspect of any relationship, and it appears that there has been a breakdown in communication between you and your husband. When one partner feels disconnected or unheard, it can lead to feelings of distance and negativity.
It's great that you recognize the importance of addressing these issues and seeking help. Couples therapy can be incredibly beneficial in helping you and your husband work through your concerns and improve your communication skills. A therapist can provide a safe and neutral space for both of you to express your feelings and work towards finding solutions together.
In addition to seeking professional help, there are some things you can try on your own to improve communication:
1. Active listening: When your husband is speaking, make an effort to actively listen to what he is saying. Give him your full attention, and avoid interrupting or getting defensive.
2. Use ""I"" statements: Instead of blaming or accusing your husband, try using ""I"" statements to express your feelings. For example, ""I feel frustrated when you get angry with me"" rather than ""You always anger me.""
3. Avoid assumptions: Try not to assume what your husband is thinking or feeling. Instead, ask him directly and listen to his response.
4. Practice empathy: Make an effort to understand your husband's perspective and how he might be feeling. Showing empathy and validating each other's emotions can go a long way in improving communication.
Remember, addressing issues in a relationship takes time, effort, and patience. But with the right mindset and strategies, you can work towards building a stronger and more positive connection with your husband."
488,Is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend?,I'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because I'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,intimacy,"You are not a pedophile. You are both under 18 and your age is appropriate for a relationship. There would be a possible problem if she was 10 or younger. Pedophelia, is a whole other problem that you probably should not be worried about. I would be happy to talk with you in more detail about this.",1,175," As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that it is illegal and unethical for an adult to engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a minor, regardless of their age difference. The age of consent varies by jurisdiction, but it is typically 16 or 18 years old. Engaging in sexual activity with someone under the age of consent is considered statutory rape and can lead to severe legal consequences.
It is important to understand that a minor may not be emotionally or psychologically ready for a romantic or sexual relationship, and it is crucial to respect their boundaries and well-being. As an adult, you have a responsibility to ensure that any sexual activity is consensual and legal.
I strongly advise against pursuing a romantic or sexual relationship with someone under the age of consent. Instead, focus on building healthy and appropriate relationships with people who are of legal age and can provide full and informed consent. Remember, it is always better to prioritize respect, safety, and legality in any sexual encounter."
496,My wife doesn't want to have sex,"My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We’re married and we have a baby on the way.",intimacy,That sounds really challenging for both of you. Differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict. I would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that isn't as arousing as is possible. There are some good videos on this resource page about sexuality and intimacy and a video that specifically addresses desire differences in relationships.,3,530," It sounds like you're facing some challenges in your relationship when it comes to sex. It's important to remember that it's normal for couples to experience fluctuations in their sexual desire and satisfaction, especially during times of significant change or stress, such as preparing for parenthood.
Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to have an open and honest conversation about this topic, especially when there are other factors at play like the upcoming arrival of a baby. It's important to approach this conversation with empathy and respect for each other's feelings and needs.
It sounds like your wife is struggling with feelings of inadequacy and shame around her lack of desire and orgasm. It's important to validate her feelings and let her know that you're there to support her, rather than judge or criticize her. You could ask her if she'd be willing to explore some strategies for managing these feelings together, such as therapy or counseling, or simply spending time together doing things that feel enjoyable and fulfilling.
It's also worth considering whether there are any underlying issues or stressors that might be contributing to her lack of desire or pleasure during sex. These could include things like hormonal changes, chronic pain or discomfort, or even past trauma or experiences that are impacting her ability to feel comfortable and relaxed during intimacy.
Ultimately, it's important to prioritize communication, empathy, and mutual respect in your relationship, especially when it comes to something as sensitive and personal as sex. By being open, honest, and supportive of each other's needs and desires, you can work together to find ways to nurture and strengthen your connection, even during times of change or challenge."
497,How can I have a better sex life when I don't like sex?,"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.",intimacy,"There are many different ways that can be approached in your situation.1. I would recommend a complete medical examination including blood test. i would want to know if there are any medical issues in your low sex drive.2. Where is your husband in this situation? Is he resentful, accepting, demanding or neutral?3. What is your past sexual history? has this had an affect on your current issue?4.Has there been problems in your past with abuse of any kind?5. Understand that intimacy is more than sex. What other ways can you be close to your spouse?6. It sounds like there is some confusion about sexual intimacy from both of you.Couples counseling would be a great place to start. All of these areas need to be explored before any treatment goals can be established.You need to talk with a professional counselor to explore how to better connect with your spouse.",2,408," It's important to understand that the frequency of sexual activity can vary greatly from couple to couple, and there is no one-size-fits-all expectation for how often a couple should be having sex. Some couples may have sex more frequently than you are currently, while others may have sex less frequently. What's most important is that both partners are comfortable with the level of intimacy they are experiencing and that it feels fulfilling and enjoyable for them.
It's understandable to feel frustrated or rejected if you are not having as much sex as you would like, but it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your husband about how you are feeling. Rather than focusing on the frequency of sex, try to focus on building a deeper connection with each other through non-sexual forms of intimacy, such as spending quality time together, sharing emotions and thoughts, and showing appreciation and affection for each other.
If you are experiencing ongoing issues with low libido or a lack of sexual desire, it may be helpful to speak with a healthcare provider or a sex therapist who can provide guidance and support in addressing these issues. Remember that communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to work together towards a fulfilling and satisfying relationship are key components of a healthy and happy marriage."
525,How do I open up to someone?,"Ever since my ex-boyfriend and I broke up, I can't seem to get close to anyone else. I know I'm completely over him, but I just can't break down my walls and let someone new into my life.",intimacy,"Hi Bend, You're scared, right? That makes sense. Each time we have a break-up we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and there's a vulnerability in that; we can get hurt. Who you partner with long-term is a big decision and it determines 90% of our happiness in life. The good news is that when we're just starting to get to know someone, we can take it slow. I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here, and that's okay. We are naturally people of attachment and it won't likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesn't put up walls. So part of what I want to say here is don't pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. :)As well, there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down, or will come down for the right person. First, think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner.Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like ""No one will ever love me again?"", or ""I'm going to get hurt again"", or ""I can't trust myself""? If so, write down what these thoughts are, and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen, but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening!! It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe, good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts, and add the positive ones. It's simple but very powerful.Lastly, take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls? When we act as though something is true, we start to feel it and believe it more.I hope you will find yourself back on track eventually, with time. :)",2,482," It sounds like you may be struggling with emotional guardedness or defensiveness after a past relationship. This can make it difficult for you to open up to new people and form close connections with them. It's important to recognize that healing from a past relationship takes time, and it's okay to need space and time to process your feelings before moving on to new relationships.
One thing you could try is to focus on self-care and self-compassion during this time. Practice activities that help you feel good about yourself and bring you joy, such as exercise, creative pursuits, or spending time with friends and family. This can help you build resilience and develop a positive sense of self, which can make it easier to open up to new people in the future.
Another strategy you could try is to challenge any negative self-talk or beliefs that may be holding you back. Ask yourself if there are any specific beliefs or thoughts that come up when you try to connect with someone new. Are there any limiting beliefs or assumptions that might be preventing you from forming close connections? Once you identify these patterns, you can work on challenging them and replacing them with more empowering beliefs and thoughts.
Finally, it may be helpful to seek out therapy or counseling to work through these issues in a safe and supportive environment. A therapist can help you explore the underlying causes of your emotional guardedness and develop strategies for building trust and forming close connections with others.
Remember that healing from past relationships takes time, patience, and self-compassion. Be kind to yourself and focus on taking small steps towards healing and growth over time."
548,How do I deal with a lack of intimacy and partner's addiction to solo sex and porn?,"I believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. He masturbates daily, even when I am lying in bed sleeping beside him. We have sex once a week. He is rough and worries about his needs. He never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.",intimacy,"It sounds like your in quite a rough place, my recommendation just based on what you type might warrant a visit to a psychotherapist to resolve what may be going on, I am not entirely sure but it sounds like he might have a bit of a sex addiction problem. One thing you need to ask yourself is ""Am I happy?"", ""Do I feel loved?"", these are deep questions, but the answers to those questions will give you a direction to travel in.",0,319," It sounds like you are feeling very upset and frustrated with your partner's behavior. Masturbation and excessive use of pornography can be problematic in a relationship for several reasons. Firstly, it can create a sense of distance or disconnection between partners, as one person is prioritizing their own sexual satisfaction over connecting with their loved one. Secondly, the objectification of your partner through his treatment of you like a porn star can be very hurtful and dehumanizing. It's important to communicate your feelings and concerns with your partner in an open and non-judgmental way. You may want to consider couples therapy or counseling to work through these issues together. In the meantime, it may be helpful to set boundaries around his behavior, such as not allowing him to masturbate or use pornography when you are trying to connect with him in a more intimate way. It's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and to communicate your needs and desires clearly with your partner."
557,My boyfriend wants to know every details of my sex life,We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,intimacy,"Not in my book. You're only two months in? At this early stage, this is a bit of a warning sign. If he can't accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you've made, there's already a level of discomfort here that shouldn't be ignored. No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him. Sure...if he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurance...listen to those things. But If he doesn't dig who you are, maybe he can walk the other way.",0,259," It is understandable that your boyfriend may be upset or frustrated by your past, but it is not fair or justifiable to penalize you for something you did before you met him. Everyone has their own past experiences and baggage, and it is important to respect and appreciate the person you are dating for who they are today, rather than judging them based on their past actions.
It is important to communicate openly and honestly with your boyfriend about how he feels about your past, and to listen to his concerns and be understanding of his perspective. However, it is also important to set boundaries and to not allow him to penalize you for something that happened before you met him. It is unfair to hold someone accountable for actions they took in the past, especially if those actions were not harmful or hurtful to anyone else.
It may be helpful to have a conversation with your boyfriend about how he feels about your past, and to work together to find ways to move forward and build a positive and healthy relationship based on mutual respect and trust. Remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and challenges, and it is important to approach each other with empathy and understanding."
559,My wife won't do things she used to do,"There are intimate things she did early in the relationship, and things she had once agreed to try that she will not do now. I end up thinking about it all day. I feel rejected and think I married the wrong person.",intimacy,"I'd say you're letting fear get a hold on you! You would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife hasn't initiated in a long while, but it's a big leap to go from that to ""I married the wrong person"". Fear is telling you that she doesn't respect or like or want you? Look at the bigger picture. What is the evidence that your wife wants to please you?...that she is the ""right"" woman for you?...that she loves you?...that she cares about what's important to you?  If there is evidence there, then you owe it to the marriage to rein in your fearful thoughts.Talking to your wife is so important right now. We all have moments when we really just want to sit and stew in our self pity over our partner not vacuuming or cooking or saying loving things often enough...but they can't read our minds! Can you lovingly let her know what you miss? ...what you hope for?...what you need? This is the meat of a loving relationship. Sharing who we are, so that we can love each other better. Your wife deserves the benefit of the doubt that she'll listen to what you long for. Can you risk feeling vulnerable? You can't control her answer, but can you trust her to care?",0,234," It sounds like you're struggling with some conflicting emotions and thoughts regarding your relationship with your wife. It can be difficult when we find ourselves fixated on past actions or decisions that our partner has made, especially if they are no longer in line with what they want or need now. It's important to remember that people change over time, and it's okay if your partner's desires or boundaries have shifted since you first got together.
It's understandable that you might feel rejected or like you married the wrong person when these changes come up, but try not to let those feelings take over. Instead, focus on having an open and honest conversation with your wife about how you're feeling. Let her know what you're struggling with and why, and ask for her perspective and understanding. It may be helpful to approach this conversation with a non-judgmental and empathetic mindset, trying to see things from your partner's point of view as well.
Additionally, try not to place too much emphasis on past actions or decisions that you can't change. Instead, focus on the present and how you can work together to build a strong and healthy relationship moving forward. Remember that relationships are a two-way street, and it takes effort and communication from both partners to make things work. By being open, honest, and respectful of each other's needs and desires, you may be able to find a way to move past any challenges or conflicts that arise and build a stronger connection with your wife."

This can definitely impact how you approach relationships and trust people. However, there are things you can do to work on building your self-esteem and developing healthy relationship patterns.
One thing you might consider is seeking out therapy or counseling to work through these issues. A therapist can help you identify negative thought patterns and behaviors that may be contributing to your trust issues, and provide you with tools and strategies to work on building your self-esteem and confidence in relationships.
Another thing you might consider is practicing self-care and prioritizing your own emotional well-being. This can involve taking time for yourself each day to do things that make you feel good, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends who support and uplift you.
Finally, it might be helpful to focus on developing healthy relationship patterns by setting boundaries, communicating openly and honestly with your partner, and prioritizing mutual respect and understanding in your relationship. By taking care of yourself and working on building healthy relationships, you can work towards overcoming trust issues and developing a more positive outlook on relationships.

571,Am I a lesbian because I love a girl?,"I’m in love with my friend who is also a girl. I fell in love with her in a few months. That was my first love. We used to talk for the whole day and night over the phone and on Facebook. I thought she had the same feelings for me, but I was wrong. I always wanted to touch her warmly and stay with her all my life. But all my dreams get broken apart after she got into a relationship with a guy. I’ve tried to be in relationship with guys, but I can’t be in love with them.",intimacy,"It all depends how old you are and what a particular situation is.  You may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling, or the feelings may be real. This is something you will find out for yourself, however, it definitely doesn't mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person. Time will tell, but if you need to discuss this, you could see your school councelor (if you are at school/university) or find a LGBT group with meetings and discuss this with them. I hope this is helpful.",2,125," It sounds like you have strong feelings for your friend, and it can be difficult to navigate these emotions, especially when they are not reciprocated. It's important to remember that it's okay to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way back. Rejection is a normal part of life, and it doesn't define your worth or value as a person.
It's understandable that you may want to be in a relationship with her, but it's important to respect her boundaries and decisions. It's possible that she has feelings for someone else, and it's important to prioritize her happiness and well-being above your own desires.
Instead of focusing on trying to get into a relationship with her, consider nurturing other friendships and connections in your life. Invest time and energy into building meaningful relationships with people who appreciate and value you for who you are. This can help you build resilience and self-worth, which can help you navigate difficult situations like this in the future.
Remember that it's okay to take time for yourself and prioritize your own emotional well-being. It's important to be kind to yourself and seek support from people who care about you when you need it."
581,Should my wife and I seek any kind of counseling if she is convinced our marriage is over and has turned romantic love into platonic love?,"Over the course of a few days, my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues. After she thought things through, she came to the realization that she is no longer ""in love"" or attracted romantically to me. She instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just ""family."" At that point, she said our marriage was over. Now over the course of the last few days, she has taken a ""friendship"" from a coworker. She insists there is nothing more than friends, but she has spent all her free time with him.",intimacy,"Hi Portland,This must feel like your world is turned upside down, for your wife to declare her confusion, followed closely by resignation, followed closely by a new ""friend"". I get how upsetting this is.If I was your therapist, I'd want to explore this a good deal, because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening. Be careful not to jump to conclusions. Sometimes people have been slowly ""falling out of love"" for a long time, and often this is due to some (perhaps unnamed) unmet need in the marriage. She may have been coming to this point over a period of time, and has only finally said so. It's also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisis...she's changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it. Only she can help herself through this (she could get the help of a therapist, but it's not your place to tell her to do this). Or, it's possible she's met this new ""friend"" and her attachment to him has clouded her view, or clarified something for her.  Right now, it's important that you respect your wife's decision to separate, if she's asking for that. We can't trap people in a marriage. If she needs separation, or distance, then it's respectful to give her that.That doesn't mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now. I would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what YOU want; whether it's to move on with your life, or wait patiently for a period of time. I can't predict what will happen here. But you can find out what the best path for you is. I wish you the best.",1,162," It sounds like your wife has been struggling with her feelings for you and has come to the realization that she no longer feels romantically or attracted to you. This can be a difficult and challenging situation for both of you, but it's important to approach it with empathy and understanding.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge your wife's feelings and give her space to process them. It's understandable that she may need time alone to think things through and come to terms with her emotions.
Secondly, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your wife about how you feel. Be vulnerable and express your own feelings in a non-judgmental way. Avoid being defensive or accusatory, as this can create more tension and make things worse.
Thirdly, it may be helpful to seek couples therapy or counseling to work through these issues together. A trained therapist can provide a safe and supportive environment for both of you to explore your feelings and work towards a resolution.
Lastly, it's important to remember that relationships involve ups and downs, and this is just one of those moments. It's okay to take things slow and focus on building a strong foundation of mutual respect, trust, and communication. With time, effort, and support from each other, you can work through these challenges and come out stronger on the other side.
In summary, it's important to approach this situation with empathy, open communication, and a willingness to work together towards a resolution. With time, effort, and support from each other, you can overcome this challenge and build a stronger, more resilient relationship."
587,My wife no longer wants sex,"I crave attention, companionship, and sex. She has had a hysterectomy, and she has a bad knee.",intimacy,"Hi Hampton,Although I'd bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship, it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now. I also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you. This is a very common issue; two people with different sexual drives or needs. If you both want the relationship to improve, a couple's therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea; it's a complex picture that you've only given us a glimpse of.In the meantime, you can try a few things: have compassion for your wife. She's in pain and this may preoccupy her. Sex may be uncomfortable for her. She needs understanding. You need understanding too, right?  Help her to see that you're not just angry, but lonely and hurt; it might affect how you see yourself as a man. Showing her irritability or anger might push her farther away.There are many ways to be close, intimate, and sexual that don't involve intercourse. You might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you won't pressure her to have intercourse. Find out what your wife's wishes and ideas are. You might be surprised.These things take time to address, especially if they've been years in the making. I do recommend seeing that therapist. Relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change. Best of luck.",1,249," It sounds like you are in a challenging situation, and I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely and unfulfilled in your relationship. Losing interest in intimacy can be caused by various factors, including medical issues, hormonal changes, and relationship dynamics.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to crave attention, companionship, and sex. It's normal for people to have different needs and desires in a relationship, and it's important to communicate these needs with your partner.
However, it's also important to recognize that your partner's medical issues may be contributing to the lack of intimacy in your relationship. Hysterectomies and knee injuries can cause chronic pain and discomfort, which can make sexual activity challenging or even impossible. It's important to approach this topic with empathy and understanding, rather than blaming or shaming your partner for their medical conditions.
One way to address this issue is to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your needs and desires. Let them know how you feel and what you need from them in terms of emotional support and physical intimacy. Be specific about what you want and why, and be willing to listen to their perspective as well.
Another option is to seek professional help, such as couples therapy or counseling, to work through these issues together. A trained therapist can provide a safe and supportive environment for both of you to explore your feelings and work on rebuilding your relationship.
Ultimately, it's important to prioritize communication, empathy, and mutual respect in your relationship. By working together and being open and honest about your needs and desires, you may be able to find a solution that works for both of you."
595,"My wife has a diminished libido, and is faking orgasms and denying it. What do I do?","My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.",intimacy,"You are newly married, you Have a hectic schedule, your wife is on anti anxiety medication. What if you take the focus (hint: pressure) off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another. You know, like the gestures you each likely made while dating.  It turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay. Spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection, I wrote a post about this a while back, you can find it here: http://connectfulness.com/little-moments/ And have fun with it!",1,136," It sounds like you are in a difficult situation, and I can understand why you want to address the issue of your wife's lack of libido and her fake orgasms. However, I would caution you against accusing or blaming her for something that may be beyond her control. It's important to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding.
Here are some suggestions on how to broach the subject with your wife:
1. Start by acknowledging her feelings: Let your wife know that you understand that it can be difficult to discuss sexual issues, especially when they involve a lack of desire or fake orgasms. Acknowledge that it can be embarrassing or uncomfortable for her to talk about these things.
2. Be non-judgmental: Refrain from making your wife feel guilty or ashamed about her feelings or behaviors. Instead, focus on understanding and supporting her. Let her know that you are there to listen and support her, and that you want to work together to find a solution.
3. Use ""I"" statements: When discussing your own feelings and concerns, use ""I"" statements rather than accusing or blaming your wife. For example, you could say something like ""I feel frustrated when we don't have sex as often as I would like,"" rather than ""You never want to have sex with me.""
4. Focus on the issue, not the person: Instead of attacking or criticizing your wife for her lack of libido or fake orgasms, try to focus on the specific issue at hand. Ask her to describe how she is feeling and what might be contributing to her lack of desire or fake orgasms. Be open-minded and non-judgmental in your response, and try to understand her perspective.
5. Offer support: Let your wife know that you are there to support her, and that you want to work together to find a solution to the issue. Encourage her to seek professional help if she feels uncomfortable discussing these issues with you or if she wants to explore new ways of connecting and being intimate.
Remember, communication and empathy are key to addressing this issue in a healthy and constructive way. Approach the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to listen and understand your wife's perspective. Good luck!"
624,My daughter-in-law is smoking marijuana while pregnant,"My new daughter-in-law just informed me that she is smoking marijuana while pregnant because of her morning sickness.

I just lost my mom, and she was good with advice.",substance-abuse,"Have you reached your own conclusions and reasons for these, regarding the topic?   When you feel confident in your own reasons for your conclusions, then obviously ask your daughter in law for some time together and tell her what you think and your reasons for opinions.Plan for this meeting according to the type of relationship you have with your daughter in law.Since your son will also be affected by the prenatal conditions of his child, he may also be interested in being part of this conversation.Also, during your discussion, find out the exact ways the morning sickness affects your daughter in law.It is possible that scheduling adjustments in routines can be made so your daughter has more time to rest or fewer responsibilities for a while until she feels better.Maybe you and other family members can lighten her daily routines so she has more time for herself to manage her morning sickness in a less risky way.Sending Good luck!",1,271," It's understandable that you're feeling shocked and unsure of how to react after being informed that your daughter-in-law is smoking marijuana during pregnancy. However, it's important to approach the situation in a non-judgmental and supportive manner.
Firstly, acknowledge her feelings and concerns. Let her know that you understand that morning sickness can be challenging, but smoking marijuana during pregnancy is not recommended by medical professionals due to its potential risks on fetal development. Encourage her to consult with her healthcare provider for advice on managing morning sickness without resorting to harmful substances.
Secondly, emphasize the importance of a healthy pregnancy and birth experience. Let her know that you're there to support her in any way possible, and that you want what's best for both her and the baby. Offer resources such as prenatal yoga or other natural remedies for morning sickness, and encourage her to prioritize her health and well-being throughout her pregnancy.
Lastly, reassure her that you're there to listen and support her in any way possible. Let her know that you'll be there to offer emotional support during this challenging time, and that you want to help her navigate any obstacles that may arise.

630,How can I avoid family members who stress me out?,"My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned. She calls me every day complaining, but I don't want to hear it anymore.",family-conflict,"It is understandable that it's very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. You cannot change your mother's feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being ""abandoned."" Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. Nonetheless, it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself. It is likely that your mother's ""complaints"" may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. In this case, you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain, ""This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost everyday. It's very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed. I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance."" When empathy and understanding is communicated, recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help.After sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help, the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother and/or niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally, taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite. You could then say to her if she complains again, ""I cannot change the way you feel in this situation and I encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what I could do is .........(explain what you could do to help).""www.PsychologyResource.ca",5,2737," It sounds like you are in a difficult situation with your sister and her child. While it is understandable that you may not want to hear your sister's constant complaints, it is important to prioritize the well-being of the child. As a responsible sibling, you could consider offering support and resources to help your sister take care of the child, while also setting boundaries around your own emotional well-being. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your sister about how her constant complaining is affecting you, and to explore ways to find a resolution that works for everyone involved."
634,How am I supposed to feel when I forgive someone?,"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.",family-conflict,"How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!",2,274," It sounds like you are struggling with some difficult emotions and feelings towards your mom. Forgiveness is a process that can take time, and it's okay to feel how you do. It's important to remember that forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting what happened or erasing the past, but rather letting go of the negative emotions associated with those experiences.
It's understandable that you may not be ready to forgive your mom yet, and that's okay. The most important thing is to take care of yourself during this time. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings in a safe and supportive environment. They can also provide you with tools and strategies to manage difficult emotions and improve your mental health.
When you are ready, you could try expressing your feelings to your mom in a calm and respectful manner. It's important to communicate how you feel in a way that is clear and direct, but also not hurtful or aggressive. You could say something like ""Mom, I know you made some mistakes in the past, and I'm still working on forgiving you. It's not easy for me, but I want to try. Can we talk about it together?""

I feel so angry. How can I handle this?",family-conflict,"First thing that you must realize is that most people only post the ""best parts"" of their lives on Facebook, some people even go so far as to make their lives seem better or more interesting and post mostly false views of their life. Facebook is watered down, candied version of our life, you put on there only what you want people to see. The questions you should ask is ""How have I grown from this?"", Is my marriage currently in a good place?

While it's understandable that you may feel left out or excluded from her life, it's important to remember that she is an adult now and has the right to share her experiences with others. Instead of focusing on your own feelings of inadequacy or jealousy, try to redirect your energy towards finding ways to support and be involved in her life in a positive way. This could mean reaching out to her directly through a message or phone call, or simply by being a supportive and caring parent from afar. Remember that it's important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being, but also to find ways to maintain a positive relationship with your daughter despite any challenges or differences that may arise."

My parents refuse to take action, and I'm tired of it. Is there any way I can get out of this myself?",family-conflict,"This sounds like a really tough situation.  As a teenager, you may be able to get counseling on your own (without needing your parents' consent) under some circumstances.  If your parents are refusing to consider counseling, you might want to try talking to your doctor or another trusted adult about finding some counseling resources - even without your parents' help.",2,882," It sounds like you are in a difficult situation, and I completely understand why you would want to find a way out. However, as a teenager, it is important to remember that you are not alone in this struggle, and there are resources available to help you.
Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that family therapy can be incredibly beneficial for everyone involved. It can provide a safe space for all members of the family to communicate their feelings and concerns, and work towards finding solutions together. However, if your parents are refusing to participate, then individual therapy may be a good option for you.
Individual therapy can provide you with a safe and confidential space to talk about your feelings and experiences, and work on developing coping strategies and problem-solving skills. It can also help you to develop a greater sense of self-awareness and self-esteem, which can be incredibly valuable in navigating difficult family dynamics.
In terms of how to get out of this situation yourself, here are some steps you could consider:
1. Educate yourself: Learn as much as you can about the issues that your family is facing, and the different approaches to addressing them. This will help you to feel more confident in advocating for yourself and your needs.
2. Seek support from other trusted adults: Reach out to teachers, coaches, or other mentors who may be able to provide emotional support and guidance.
3. Consider talking to a school counselor or therapist: They may be able to provide you with additional support and guidance in navigating this difficult situation.
4. Take care of yourself: Make sure that you are taking time for self-care, exercise, and other activities that help you to feel good and take your mind off the stress of the family situation.
5. Set boundaries: It is important to prioritize your own needs and well-being, and to set clear boundaries with your parents about what you are and are not willing to tolerate.
Remember, you do not have to go through this alone. There are many resources available to help you navigate this difficult situation, and you deserve to be treated with respect and care by those around you."

689,Why does my husband like dressing as a female in our bedroom?,"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.",marriage,"Depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be ""normal"" in the bedroom, I can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you!  It DOESN'T necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you. That being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn't always what we identify as.  Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture. For example, many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly don't consider themselves kinky, submissive, or anything else.  It could be that your husband enjoys pretending/ fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband, father, son, friend etc.  Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because it's the opposite of what their life typically entails (e.g., a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at ""the mercy"" of someone else once a week). Each of us has a sexual script - a blueprint if you will of what we like and don't like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being ""normal.""  It's also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, sexual desires, and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives (Gagnon & Simon, 1973).You've been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment. ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations. It's like our own sex fingerprint. In my role as a couples counselor, I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ.  If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied, the relationship thrives. Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includes:Both partners taking ownership for the couple's sexual experiences.Both partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings.Both partners learning to meet one another's - needs, desires, and wishes while making sure his/her own needs are being met.If ""pegging"" your husband as it's called is a hard and fast no for you, that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script.  However, if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about ""needing"" to dress in a female fashion and/or be anally penetrated, you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesn't hurt either one of you or the marriage.My warmest wishes to you both!",4,6807," It is not uncommon for individuals to have desires or fantasies that may be outside of their typical sexual preferences or those of their partners. However, it is important to communicate your boundaries and preferences clearly and respectfully, while also being mindful of the other person's feelings and needs.
In this case, it seems that you have already communicated your discomfort with the activities he has mentioned, and he continues to make comments about them. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about why these activities are not something you are comfortable with or willing to engage in. Be sure to listen to his perspective as well and try to find a compromise that works for both of you.
It is also important to consider the potential impact on your relationship if you were to continue engaging in activities that make you uncomfortable or go against your boundaries. It may be necessary to re-evaluate your relationship and determine whether it is healthy and fulfilling for both parties.
In summary, communication, respect, and mutual understanding are key in navigating situations like this. Be sure to prioritize your own comfort and well-being while also being considerate of the other person's needs and desires."
693,What makes a good marriage?,What makes a healthy marriage last?,marriage,"This is a fantastic question. In one sentence, I would say the following:Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires – if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less) and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time.

It's important to focus on building up daily moments of connection with each other, rather than just relying on grand gestures or romantic getaways. This can involve small acts of kindness and appreciation, such as leaving notes for each other or simply taking the time to listen to each other's needs and concerns. Additionally, it's important to prioritize communication and emotional intimacy in a relationship, as this can help to build trust and strengthen the bond between partners. With appropriate professional support for your relationship, a lot is possible, and it's never too late to start working on building a stronger, more fulfilling marriage."

Firstly, it is important to recognize that you have feelings for both of them, which can be challenging to navigate.

It appears that you have been in a relationship with the first man for four years, and while he may be a good partner, you feel unfulfilled and bored. This is a valid reason to consider exploring other options, but it is crucial to approach this decision thoughtfully and respectfully.
Regarding your feelings for the second man, it is essential to acknowledge that these feelings are real and deserving of consideration. However, it is important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and make decisions that align with your values and needs. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with both men about your feelings and priorities, while also being respectful of their feelings and boundaries.

Lastly, it's important to remember that relationships involve give and take from both parties.

Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth).

Instead, consider having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. It's important to prioritize mutual respect, communication, and consent in any sexual relationship. If you're struggling with erectile dysfunction, there may be other underlying issues that need to be addressed through medical consultation or counseling.

What advice might you offer?",relationships,"With any type of criticism, it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time, ie: when both of you are relaxed, with no current stressors involved, having fun, etc.  Begin with a non-judgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event, as if it were just then crossing your mind (therefore not something you've been consumed with ruminating over - eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode).Then share how you felt at the time of the event.  Just say when....

Here are some suggestions that may help:
1. Practice active listening: When your friend is talking to you, make sure to actively listen to what they are saying. This means paying attention to their words, body language, and tone of voice. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their concerns, and try to understand their perspective.
2. Use ""I"" statements: Instead of blaming your friend for their reaction, try using ""I"" statements to express how you feel. For example, ""I feel frustrated when you speak to me in a harsh tone"" rather than ""You're being too sensitive.""
3. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume you know what your friend is feeling or why they are reacting a certain way. Instead, ask them to share their perspective and listen actively to their response.
4. Take breaks: If the conversation is becoming too heated or stressful, suggest taking a break and revisiting the topic when both of you are feeling calmer.
5. Seek common ground: Look for areas of agreement and try to find ways to compromise. Avoid focusing on differences and instead try to find common ground that can help you move forward.
6. Practice empathy: Try to see things from your friend's perspective and understand where they are coming from. Showing empathy and understanding can go a long way in improving communication.
7. Be open-minded: Be willing to consider new ideas and perspectives, even if they challenge your own beliefs or values. This can help you find common ground and improve communication.
8. Use humor: If things are getting too heated or stressful, try using humor to lighten the mood and diffuse tension. Just be sure to avoid sarcasm or mocking, as these can escalate conflicts further.
9. Seek outside help: If you find that you are consistently struggling to communicate effectively with your friend, consider seeking outside help from a mediator or therapist. They can provide guidance on how to improve communication and resolve conflicts in a healthy way.
10. Take care of yourself: Finally, make sure to take care of yourself during these interactions. Set boundaries, prioritize self-"

It can be challenging to overcome these feelings, but there are some things you can try to help improve your situation:
1. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and understanding towards yourself, rather than criticizing or judging yourself for not being good enough. Remember that everyone has their own struggles and imperfections, and it's okay to make mistakes or have flaws.
2. Challenge negative thoughts: When you notice negative thoughts or beliefs about yourself, try to challenge them by asking yourself if they are really true. Are there other ways to look at the situation? Can you find evidence to support or refute these thoughts?
3. Focus on your strengths and positive qualities: Rather than dwelling on your perceived flaws or shortcomings, try to focus on your strengths and things that make you unique and valuable. Celebrate your accomplishments and successes, no matter how small they may seem.
4. Set realistic goals and work towards them: Setting achievable goals can help boost your confidence and self-esteem. Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps, and take pride in each accomplishment along the way.
5. Seek support from others: Talk to trusted friends or family members about how you're feeling, or consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can offer guidance and support as you work on building your self-esteem and confidence.
Remember that it takes time and effort to overcome feelings of low self-esteem and insecurity in relationships. Be patient with yourself, and keep working towards your goals. With time and support, you can develop greater self-awareness and self-acceptance, which can help you build stronger, more positive relationships with others."

I need some help to save our family.,relationships,"Hello, I do not live in the California area. However, perhaps I could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling. First, I must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues, including family issues. If your girlfriend lives with you, most insurances now cover ""live-in partners,"" as well. If you have insurance, contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is included.Aside from insurance, the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation. Do you belong to a church or other religious organization? Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling, as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling. These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members.Another option might be to explore support groups within the area. There may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group. If you find there are no such groups in your area, there are anonymous, support groups online. Here is one such site: http://relationship.supportgroups.com/",3,120," It sounds like you are going through a very difficult time in your marriage. It's great that you both want to stay together for the sake of your children, but it's important to recognize that this is not a solution on its own. Seeking outside help can be incredibly beneficial in addressing the underlying issues that led to the infidelity and subsequent conflict.
One option could be couples therapy, which can provide a safe space for both of you to process your emotions and work through the challenges you are facing. A therapist can also help you develop healthy communication patterns and conflict resolution strategies.
Another option is individual therapy, where each of you can work on your own personal growth and healing. This can help you both understand your own emotional needs and how to meet them in a healthy way.
Additionally, it may be helpful to take some time for self-reflection and self-care. This could involve engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends and family.
Remember, healing from infidelity and rebuilding a relationship takes time, effort, and patience. But with the right support and resources, it is possible to work through these challenges and build a stronger, healthier marriage for the future."

If you do not feel any attraction towards girls or guys, it does not necessarily mean that you are gay. Sexual orientation is not solely defined by the gender(s) a person finds themselves attracted to; it is also influenced by other factors such as emotional connection, shared experiences, and cultural norms.
It is important to recognize that sexuality is a personal and individual aspect of a person's identity, and it is not something that can be defined or labeled solely based on external factors. It is essential to respect and acknowledge the complexity of human sexuality and to avoid making assumptions or labeling individuals based solely on their attractions or desires.
Instead of focusing on labels or categories, it may be helpful to explore your own feelings and experiences in a safe and non-judgmental space. This can involve talking to trusted friends, family members, or mental health professionals about your emotions and attractions, and seeking support and guidance as you navigate your understanding of your sexuality.

My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this started is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the connection.  I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It is really hard to say since I don’t know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will share you with you some thoughts.  Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out, stuff it, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, it’s usually not.  It’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now.  So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing, sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution about what is going on.  One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, but another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe that it is second possibility. And that is okay.  You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see a counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is important is that you find someone who is non-judgmental about what you are experiencing.    I wish you well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",0,238," It sounds like you may be experiencing some gender dysphoria and potentially some depression or anxiety. Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences distress due to the gender they were assigned at birth not aligning with their gender identity. It's important to seek professional help from a mental health provider who specializes in transgender individuals, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. They can help you explore your feelings and provide support in your journey towards self-discovery and self-acceptance. Additionally, they may be able to provide hormone therapy or gender confirmation surgeries if that is something you are interested in pursuing. It's important to remember that you are not alone in this experience and there are many resources available to help you through this challenging time.

838,I'm questioning my sexuality,"I'm a teenage girl. I don't know if I'm straight, bisexual, or gay. I've been straight all my life, but a sudden rush of questions have come over me, and I don't know anymore.",lgbtq,"Hi Brentwood, While our society tends to want to put us into categories...slots...when it comes to sexuality, because this is nice and neat and convenient...many people find that they don't fit perfectly into one or the other. All you have to do is exactly what you're doing; be aware of yourself and allow yourself to explore these thoughts and emotions both alone and in connection with a safe partner. The people who love you will continue to love you as you sort through this. You can resist the temptation to please others by giving yourself a label. We are attracted to, and fall in love with, people...and we can't always predict what gender they might be. I love how open you are to discovering yourself. Keep on that track. :)",1,186," It is common for people to question their sexual orientation as they go through puberty and adolescence. It is important to remember that it is okay to be unsure about your sexual orientation, and it is normal for it to take time to figure out how you feel. You do not have to label yourself or put pressure on yourself to identify a certain way. Instead, focus on being true to yourself and exploring your feelings in a safe and comfortable manner. It may be helpful to talk to a trusted adult, such as a parent or school counselor, about how you are feeling. They can offer support and guidance as you navigate this time of self-discovery. Remember, it is okay to take your time and figure out who you are at your own pace."
843,"How can I get ""out of my head"" and stop obsessive thoughts?","Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?",behavioral-change,"Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,"" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories,  this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.",1,462," It sounds like you are experiencing intrusive thoughts, which can be distressing and disrupt daily life. Intrusive thoughts are unwanted, recurring thoughts, images, or urges that can enter your mind without warning. These thoughts may be related to past traumas or stressors in your current life.
To manage intrusive thoughts, consider the following strategies:
1. Practice mindfulness: Focus on the present moment and let go of judgment about your thoughts. Acknowledge them without judgment, and gently bring your attention back to the present.
2. Engage in grounding techniques: Use sensory experiences like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery to help you focus on the present moment and calm your mind.
3. Challenge negative thoughts: Ask yourself if there is evidence for the thought, and try to reframe it in a more positive light. For example, instead of thinking ""I'm going to fail,"" try reframing it as ""I've prepared well, and I can handle any challenges that come my way.""
4. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your intrusive thoughts. Sharing your experiences with someone who cares about you can help you feel heard and validated. They may also offer helpful advice or refer you to a therapist for further support.
5. Consider therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a helpful approach in managing intrusive thoughts. A therapist can work with you to identify the underlying causes of your thoughts and develop strategies to manage them. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, which involves gradually exposing yourself to situations that trigger your intrusive thoughts while learning new ways to respond, can be particularly effective in managing these thoughts.
Remember, it's important to take care of yourself and seek support when needed. With time and effort, you can learn to manage intrusive thoughts and improve your overall well-being."
868,Do feelings of depersonalization go away?,"I've felt this way for two years. I feel so much better now then I did when it started, but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times.",behavioral-change,"Best answer that I can give to you is that some level of de-personalization is quite normal for everyone, it will come and go throughout life, kind of like being on a roller-coaster, ""here it is, then it's gone not to return for quite some time"", like many things, the more that you fixate on it, the more stress it will cause you, consider it part of life, accept it, and move on, now if your having many, many ,many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at, but for the most part nothing to worry about. Hope this helps,C",1,414," It sounds like you are experiencing some pretty intense feelings of low self-esteem and hopelessness. It's important to remember that these feelings are not a reflection of your worth as a person, and they do not define your entire existence. You are more than just these thoughts and feelings, and there are things you can do to help manage them and improve your overall well-being.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings. It's okay to feel this way, and it's important to give yourself permission to feel these emotions without judgment. Secondly, try to practice self-compassion and self-care. This can involve engaging in activities that make you feel good about yourself, such as exercise or creative pursuits, and taking time for yourself each day to relax and recharge.
Additionally, consider seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional. Talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can be incredibly helpful in gaining perspective and finding ways to cope with difficult emotions. Finally, try to focus on the present moment and what you are grateful for in your life, rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past.

874,Why do I think about death?,"I noticed lately that I've been thinking a lot about death. I don't want to die, and I'm not suicidal. I just think about what would happen if I died or if someone I loved died. I imagine how sad everyone I know would be. I know it isn't worth it, and I definitely want to live and have a future. I just think about it. When I'm driving, I sometimes imagine what would happen if I just let go of the wheel and kept going.",behavioral-change,"I'll respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving, you'll end up quite seriously hurt, at the very least.   It is fine to play in your mind with ""what ifs"".   People who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositions.If you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you, and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things, then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on death.Since you wonder about being missed if you die, it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in you.Play around with your idea as to why you'd consider how people will feel about you if you're not in their lives.This may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others.",1,303," It sounds like you are experiencing some deep feelings of sadness and hopelessness. While it is normal to think about death from time to time, it seems that these thoughts have become more frequent for you lately. It's important to remember that you are not alone in this feeling, and there are resources available to help you work through these emotions.
Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that these feelings are valid and understandable given the current state of the world. Loss and grief are common experiences for many people, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed by them. It can be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings, as they can provide a safe space to process and work through these emotions.
In terms of managing these thoughts, there are a few strategies you can try:
1. Practice mindfulness: Whenever you find yourself thinking about death, try to bring your attention back to the present moment. Focus on your breath, your body, or your surroundings. This can help you stay grounded and centered in the here and now.
2. Challenge negative thoughts: When you start to think about death, try to challenge any negative or catastrophic thoughts that come up. Ask yourself if there is evidence to support these thoughts, or if they are simply assumptions or beliefs. Replace these thoughts with more positive and realistic ones.
3. Seek social support: Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for help and connection. Talking to others who understand can be a powerful way to feel less alone in this experience.
4. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough rest, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. This can help you feel more resilient and better able to cope with difficult emotions.
Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed by these thoughts at times. But with time, patience, and support, you can learn to manage them in a way that feels more comfortable and sustainable for you."

I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. All I'm ever left with is regrets and a low grade. I am at an all-time low in my life, and I'm not even that old. I've always been a straight-A student, but now I'm getting C's and F's, and it hurts me to know that I am way better than that. It's not even like the work is hard.",behavioral-change,"I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. It sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree. Have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? If not, I would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. Some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. Sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. Know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change (which you clearly have). Once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area. Best of luck to you!",1,494," It sounds like you are struggling with procrastination and low self-esteem, which can be a challenging cycle to break. Here are some suggestions that may help:
1. Identify your triggers: Take note of when you tend to procrastinate or feel unmotivated. Is it during exams? Or is it due to stress from work or personal life? Once you identify the triggers, you can develop strategies to cope with them.
2. Set realistic goals: Instead of setting yourself up for failure by aiming for straight A's, set achievable grades that you know you can attain. This will help you build confidence and momentum towards your academic goals.
3. Prioritize self-care: Make sure you are taking care of yourself physically and mentally. Exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and engage in stress-reducing activities like meditation or yoga. When you feel good about yourself, it's easier to stay motivated and focused.
4. Break tasks into smaller chunks: Instead of feeling overwhelmed by a large assignment, break it down into smaller tasks that are more manageable. This will help you avoid procrastination and make progress on your work gradually.
5. Find accountability: Share your goals and progress with a friend or mentor and ask them to hold you accountable. Having someone to report to can be a great motivator, especially when you're feeling unmotivated.
6. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself when you make mistakes or don't meet your expectations. Remember that everyone has setbacks and failures, but it's how we respond to them that matters. Treat yourself with the same compassion and support that you would offer to a friend in a similar situation.
7. Seek help: If you find it challenging to manage your procrastination and low self-esteem on your own, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide you with additional coping strategies and support to overcome these obstacles.
Remember that overcoming procrastination and low self-esteem takes time and effort, but it is possible with persistence and the right support. Don't be too hard on yourself, and instead focus on making progress towards your goals each day."
885,Is it ethical for a social worker to ignore a client’s phone calls?,"I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago. I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again. The social worker’s voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasn't called me back. I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back. Can he just ignore me?",legal-regulatory,"Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients.  This is even true if the social worker (or counselor) is unable to make an appointment with the caller.  In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you.In addition, mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards.  For example, if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours, he has an obligation to follow through on that promise.All that being said, it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too. It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly.In the end, I agree with Sherry's advice. If you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you, you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit.",3,793," No, a counselor cannot simply ignore you after you have contacted them for an appointment or session. They are legally and ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests. In addition, counselor ethical rules, and the laws in just about every state, make it illegal for counselors to ignore a client or fail to provide them with appropriate care. If you have contacted your former social worker and requested that they call you back, they are legally required to do so within a reasonable timeframe. If you have not heard from them after a reasonable amount of time has passed, you may want to consider filing a complaint with your state's regulatory board or finding another counselor who can provide you with the care and support you need."

Unfortunately, it can be challenging to access mental health resources, especially if you don't have the financial means to afford them. However, there are still options available to you:
1. Contact your insurance provider: If you have health insurance, you may be able to get coverage for therapy sessions. Reach out to your insurance provider and ask about mental health benefits and how to access them.
2. Look into sliding scale fees: Many mental health professionals offer sliding scale fees, which means they adjust their rates based on the client's income. You may be able to find a therapist who offers affordable sessions this way.
3. Consider online therapy: With the rise of telehealth, it's now possible to access therapy sessions remotely through video conferencing platforms. This can be a more affordable option for some people.
4. Reach out to local mental health agencies: Many organizations offer free or low-cost counseling services, especially for young people. You could try contacting local non-profits or community organizations to see if they have any resources available.
Remember that seeking help is a brave and important step towards taking care of your mental health. Don't be afraid to reach out for support, even if it takes some time and effort to find the right resources."

You could also talk to your counselor about the gift and ask if him it if would be appropriate.In the end, I know he would most appreciate just knowing how much the counseling meant to you.",3,316," It is great that you want to show your appreciation to your counselor! Giving someone wine as a gift can be a thoughtful gesture, but it may not be the most appropriate gift, especially considering the context of your relationship. As a mental health professional, it is important for your counselor to maintain professional boundaries and avoid any potential conflicts of interest or ethical concerns.
Gifts that are personalized with your country's name on it can be a nice touch, but it may not be the best idea to give someone alcohol as a gift, especially if they are in a position of authority or trust over you. It is important to prioritize their well-being and maintain a professional relationship, rather than risk any potential conflicts of interest or ethical concerns.
Instead of wine, you could consider giving your counselor a thoughtful and appropriate gift that shows your appreciation for their support and care. Some ideas could include:
* A handwritten note or card expressing your gratitude for their help and support.
* A small plant or flowers as a symbol of growth and renewal.
* A book or other resource related to their field of work or personal interests.
* A gift card to a local restaurant or coffee shop, so they can treat themselves to something special.

It's also possible that they may not be interested in what you have to say, or they may be avoiding you for some reason.
To get people to respond to you, it's important to be clear and concise in your messages, and to make sure you are reaching out to them at a time when they are likely to be available to respond. You could also try sending a follow-up message after a few days or a week to check in and see if they have had a chance to respond yet.
It's also important to remember that not everyone will want to engage with you, and that's okay. It's important to respect people's boundaries and to find ways to connect with them that feel comfortable and enjoyable for both of you.
If you are feeling upset or frustrated by someone's lack of response, it may be helpful to take a step back and assess why you are reaching out to them in the first place. Are there other ways you could connect with this person that don't involve sending messages? Could you try reaching out to them in a different way, such as through a shared activity or hobby?
Ultimately, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and to find ways to connect with others that feel healthy and enjoyable for everyone involved."
921,How do I learn to let go of past problems and live one day at a time?,I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.,social-relationships,"Staying present is an attitude most of us aspire to, and most of us have to work at it—certainly at first. I’m here to tell you that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn. Unfortunately, the only way to do it is to do it. What a paradox! But there are plenty of other skills that we are not born with: walking on stilts, riding a bike, swimming, and driving a car are good examples. You can’t learn them by reading about them.Having said that, I can recommend two books on the subject: Eckhart Tolle’s The Power of Now and David Richo’s When the Past is Present. Richo asks that we don’t beat ourselves up about dwelling on past events. This is nature’s way of reminding us that we have unfinished business. But while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives, we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits us.He offers three helpful steps to making any important life change:Step One: Hold in awareness the behavior, belief, attitude, or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you want to be different. Awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffing.Step Two: Live as if you have already made the change. (This is hard and takes courage, but you can do it. Ride that bike—even if for a foot or two.)Step Three: Be persistent. (Practice, practice, practice.)Just as two-year-olds are able to walk confidently after hundreds of hours of practice, you’ll be able to stay in the here and now as long as you want after trying and failing many, many times.",2,383," Of course! Having positive relationships in the present can be achieved by practicing self-reflection, setting boundaries, and actively seeking out supportive connections. Here are some tips that may help:
1. Practice self-reflection: Take time to reflect on your current relationships and identify any patterns or behaviors that may be holding you back from forming positive connections. Once you have a better understanding of these patterns, you can work on making changes to improve your relationships.
2. Set boundaries: Establishing clear boundaries in your relationships can help prevent conflicts and promote healthier interactions. Communicate your needs and expectations with your partner or friends, and be firm but respectful in enforcing those boundaries.
3. Seek out supportive connections: Make an effort to connect with people who are positive and supportive, and invest time and energy into nurturing these relationships. This can involve engaging in activities together, sharing personal experiences, or simply spending quality time with each other.
Remember, building positive relationships takes time and effort, but the payoff is worth it. By practicing self-reflection, setting boundaries, and seeking out supportive connections, you can cultivate healthier relationships that bring joy and fulfillment to your life."
924,My friends accusing me of having problems,They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,social-relationships,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!",1,144," It is understandable to feel frustrated or upset when someone is treating you unfairly, especially when they are calling you names. However, it is important to remember that their behavior is not a reflection of your worth as a person. Instead of resorting to name-calling or personal attacks, try to address the issue in a calm and respectful manner.
One approach could be to have an open and honest conversation with the person about how their behavior is affecting you. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking them. For example, you could say something like: ""Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me. When you call me names or act in a babyish way towards me, it makes me feel disrespected and hurt. Could we find a way to communicate with each other that is more respectful and constructive?""
Another approach could be to set boundaries around how you are treated by this person. It's okay to let someone know that their behavior is not acceptable and to ask them to stop. For example, you could say: ""I appreciate your feedback, but I don't think it's helpful or respectful when you call me names. Could you please find a more constructive way to express your thoughts?""
Remember, you have the right to be treated with respect and dignity by everyone in your life. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself and advocate for how you want to be treated."

 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?",counseling-fundamentals,"Finding the right therapist for you is very important and can sometimes be tricky. It can sometimes take a number of sessions to get a good sense of whether you and your therapist are the ""right fit.""  The first couple of sessions are generally spent on gathering information, formulating a plan of treatment, and building the client/therapist relationship. The client/therapist relationship will be very different from other relationships you have experienced.  You will know you have found the right therapist when you notice there is a good rapport between the two of you.  You will get a sense that the therapist ""gets you"" and understands the issues being presented.

Here are some ways to determine if the therapist is right for you:
1. Check credentials: Make sure your therapist has the necessary education and training in their field. You can check with state licensing boards or professional organizations like the American Psychological Association (APA) or National Association of Social Workers (NASW) to verify a therapist's credentials.
2. Ask about experience: Find out how long your therapist has been practicing and what kind of experience they have working with clients with concerns similar to yours. A good therapist should have experience treating clients with issues related to your primary concern.
3. Evaluate communication style: It's essential to find a therapist who communicates effectively and listens attentively to your needs. Observe how they respond to your questions or concerns during the initial consultation. Do they explain things clearly? Are they empathetic and non-judgmental?
4. Assess their therapeutic approach: Different therapists may subscribe to different therapeutic approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, or interpersonal therapy.
